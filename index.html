But for every group of "living-room players" there is someone who is "at one with the board." In <b>Word Freak</b>, Stefan Fatsis introduces readers to those few, exploring the underground world of colorful characters for which the Scrabble game is life-playing competitively in tournaments across the country. It is also the story of how the Scrabble game was invented by an unemployed architect during the Great Depression and how it has grown into the hugely successful, challenging, and beloved game it is today. Along the way, Fatsis chronicles his own obsession with the game and his development as a player from novice to expert. More than a book about hardcore Scrabble players, <b>Word Freak</b> is also an examination of notions of brilliance, memory, language, competition, and the mind that celebrates the uncanny creative powers in us all.<p>A Book Sense 76 pick.</p></p><p>Like a cross between a linguistic spy and a lexicographic Olympic athlete, journalist Stefan Fatsis gave himself a year to penetrate the highest echelons of international Scrabble competition. <i>Word Freak</i> is the account of his journey. It's a wacky grab bag of travelogue, history, party journal, and psychological study of the misfits and goofballs whose lives are measured out in Scrabble tiles.<p> Fatsis gives us all the facts about Scrabble--from the story of the down-on-his-luck architect who invented the game in the 1930s to the intricacies of individual international competitions and the corporate wars to control the world's favorite word game. He keeps the reader turning the pages as we get involved in the lives of the Scrabble obsessives: men and women who have a point to prove against the world and have chosen Scrabble as their playground and their pulpit. As Fatsis goes on his own quest to attain the coveted 1600 rating, we actually get obsessed with him as he lies awake at night pondering moves and memorizing lists of words. For anybody who is interested in words, <i>Word Freak</i> provides an entertaining and absorbing read. <i>--Dwight Longenecker, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>"Drama, strategy, controversy, pathos. The rich panorama of emotion. Synchronized swimming? No. Scrabble. Who knew?" --Bob Costas, NBC Sports broadcaster and author of FAIR BALL <p>"An engrossing, inside look at the strange and rarefied world of competitive Scrabble. It's a pleasure to experience vicariously a level of play that I'll never achieve!" --Will Shortz, New York Times Crossword Editor and Puzzle Master of NPR's "Weekend Edition Sunday" </p><p>"As they say in the Scrabble world, Fatsis got great tiles when he set out to write this book -- a slew of memorable characters, and a competitive subculture as bizarre as any I've ever seen in sport. I really enjoyed WORD FREAK." --Frank DeFord</p></p><h2>Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940: How Americans Lived Through the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression</h2><p>The twenties and thirties witnessed dramatic changes in American life: increasing urbanization, technological innovation, cultural upheaval, and economic disaster. In this fascinating book, the prize-winning historian David E. Kyvig describes everyday life in these decades, when automobiles and home electricity became commonplace, when radio and the movies became broadly popular.</p><p>David E.

Presidents themselves read it and assign it to their staff for study, as did the intructors of hundreds of thousands of students of government. Now Richard Neustadt re-examines the theory of presidential power by testing it against events and decisions in the administrations of the later modern presidents who followed FDR, Truman and Eisenhower. To the original study of presidential power, Neustadt has added a series of chapters appraising the presidential styles and skills of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan in the light of his guiding belief that the President must consider the effect a decision will have on his prospects for the successful exercise of presidential power in the future.</p><p>Richard E. Neustadt is Douglas Dillon Professor of Government in the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. For three decades an advisor to presidents, their aides, and to members of the cabinet, he is the author of <i>Alliance Politics</i> and the influential study, <i>Presidential Power.</i><b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>Leader or Clerk?</b><br><br>In the United States we like to "rate" a President. We measure him as "weak" or "strong" and call what we are measuring his "leadership." We do not wait until a man is dead; we rate him from the moment he takes office. We are quite right to do so. His office has become the focal point of politics and policy in our political system. Our commentators and our politicians make a specialty of taking the man's measurements. The rest of us join in when we feel "government" impinging on our private lives. In the third quarter of the twentieth century millions of us have that feeling often.<br><br>This book is an endeavor to illuminate what we are measuring. Although we all make judgments about presidential leadership, we often base our judgments upon images of office that are far removed from the reality. We also use those images when we tell one another whom to choose as President. But it is risky to appraise a man in office or to choose a man for office on false premises about the nature of his job. When the job is the Presidency of the United States the risk becomes excessive. I hope this book can help reduce the risk.<br><br>We deal here with the President himself and with his influence on governmental action. In institutional terms the Presidency now includes two thousand men and women. The President is only one of them. But his performance scarcely can be measured without focusing on him. In terms of party, or of country, or the West, so-called, his leadership involves far more than governmental action. But the sharpening of spirit and of values and of purposes is not done in a vacuum. Although governmental action may not be the whole of leadership, all else is nurtured by it and gains meaning from it. Yet if we treat the Presidency as the President, we cannot measure him as though he were the government. Not action as an outcome but his impact on the outcome is the measure of the man. His strength or weakness, then, turns on his personal capacity to influence the conduct of the men who make up government. His influence becomes the mark of leadership. To rate a President according to these rules, one looks into the man's own capabilities as seeker and as wielder of effective influence upon the other men involved in governing the country. That is what this book will do.<br><br>Presidential on the title page means nothing but the President. Power means his influence. It helps to have these meanings settled at the start.<br><br>There are two ways to study "presidential power." One way is to focus on the tactics, so to speak, of influencing certain men in given situations: how to get a bill through Congress, how to settle strikes, how to quiet cabinet feuds, or how to stop a Suez. The other way is to step back from tactics on those "givens" and to deal with influence in more strategic terms: what is its nature and what are its sources? What can this man accomplish to improve the prospect that he will have influence when he wants it? Strategically, the question is not how he masters Congress in a peculiar instance, but what he does to boost his chance for mastery in any instance, looking toward tomorrow from today. The second of these two ways has been chosen for this book.<br><br>II<br><br>To look into the strategy of presidential influence one must decide at whom to look. Power problems vary with scope and scale of government, the state of politics, the progress of technology, the pace of world relationships. Power in the 1960s cannot be acquired or employed on the same terms as those befitting Calvin Coolidge or Theodore Roosevelt or Grover Cleveland or James K. Polk. But there is a real likelihood that in the next decade a President will have to reach for influence and use it under much the same conditions we have known since the Second World War. If so, the men whose problems shed most light on the White House prospects are Dwight David Eisenhower and Harry S Truman. It is at them, primarily, that we shall look. To do so is to see the shadow of another, Franklin D. Roosevelt. They worked amidst the remnants of his voter coalition, and they filled an office that his practice had enlarged.<br><br>Our two most recent Presidents have had in common something that is likely to endure into our future: the setting for a great deal of their work. They worked in an environment of policy and politics marked by a high degree of continuity. To sense the continuity from Truman's time through Eisenhower's one need only place the newspapers of 1959 alongside those of 1949. Save for the issue of domestic communists, the subject matter of our policy and politics remains almost unchanged. We deal as we have clone in terms of cold war, of an arms race, of a competition overseas, of danger from inflation, and of damage from recession. We skirmish on the frontiers of the welfare state and in the borderlands of race relations. Aspects change, but labels stay the same. So do dilemmas. Everything remains unfinished business. Not in this century has there been comparable continuity from a decade's beginning to its end; count back from 1949 and this grows plain. There even has been continuity in the behavior of our national electorate; what Samuel Lubell nine years ago called "stalemate" in our partisan alignments has not broken yet.<br><br>The similarities in Truman's setting and in Eisenhower's give their years a unity distinct from the war years, or the depression era, or the twenties, or before. In governmental terms, at least, the fifteen years since V-J day deserve a designation all their own. "Midcentury" will serve for present purposes. And what distinguishes midcentury can be put very briefly: emergencies in policy with politics as usual.<br><br>"Emergency" describes midcentury conditions only by the standards of the past. By present standards what would once have been emergency is commonplace. Policy dilemmas through the postwar period resemble past emergencies in one respect, their difficulty and complexity for government. Technological innovation, social and political change abroad, population growth at home impose enormous strains not only on the managerial equipment of our policymakers but also on their intellectual resources. The gropings of mature men at midcentury remind one of the intellectual confusions stemming from depression, thirty years ago, when men were also pushed past comprehension by the novelty of their condition. In our time innovation keeps us constantly confused; no sooner do we start to comprehend than something new is added and we grope again. But unlike the great difficulties of the past, our policy dilemmas rarely produce what the country feels as crisis. Not even the Korean War brought anything approaching sustained national consensus. Since 1945 innumerable situations have been felt as crises inside government; there rarely has been comparable feeling outside government. In the era of the Cold War we have practiced "peacetime" politics. What else could we have done? Cold War is not a crisis; it becomes a way of life.<br><br>Our politics has been as usual, but only by the standard of past crises. In comparison with what was once normality, our politics has been unusual. The weakening of party ties, the emphasis on personality, the close approach of world events, the changeability of public moods, and above all the ticket splitting, none of this was usual before the Second World War. The symbol of midcentury political conditions is the White House in one party's hands with Congress in the other's -- a symbol plainly visible in eight of the past fifteen years and all but visible in four of the remaining seven. Nothing really comparable has been seen in this country since the 1880s. And the eighties were not troubled by emergencies in policy.<br><br>As for politics and policy combined, we have seen some precursors of our setting at midcentury. Franklin Roosevelt had a reasonably comparable setting in his middle years as President, though not in his first years and not after Pearl Harbor. Indeed, if one excepts the war, midcentury could properly be said to start with Roosevelt's second term. Our recent situation is to be compared, as well, with aspects of the Civil War. Abraham Lincoln is much closer to us in condition than in time, the Lincoln plagued by Radicals and shunned by Democrats amid the managerial and intellectual confusions of twentieth-century warfare in the nineteenth century. And in 1919 Woodrow Wilson faced and was defeated by conditions something like our own. But save for these men one can say of Truman and of Eisenhower that they were the first who had to fashion presidential influence out of midcentury materials. Presumably they will not be the last.<br><br>III<br><br>We tend to measure Truman's predecessors as though "leadership" consisted of initiatives in economics, or diplomacy, or legislation, or in mass communication. If we measured him and his successors so, they would be leaders automatically. A striking feature of our recent past has been the transformation into routine practice of the actions we once treated as exceptional. A President may retain liberty, in Woodrow Wilson's phrase, "to be as big a man as he can." But nowadays he cannot be as small as he might like.<br><br>Our two most recent Presidents have gone through all the motions we traditionally associate with strength in office. So will the man who takes the oath on January 20, 1961. In instance after instance the exceptional behavior of our earlier "strong" Presidents has now been set by statute as a regular requirement. Theodore Roosevelt once assumed the steward's role in the emergency created by the great coal strike of 1902; the Railway Labor Act and the Taft-Hartley Act now make such interventions mandatory upon Presidents. The other Roosevelt once asserted personal responsibility for gauging and for guiding the American economy; the Employment Act binds his successors to that task. Wilson and FDR became chief spokesmen, leading actors, on a world stage at the height of war; now UN membership, far-flung alliances, prescribe that role continuously in times termed "peace." Through both world wars our Presidents grappled experimentally with an emergency-created need to integrate foreign and military policies; the National Security Act now takes that need for granted as a constant of our times. FDR and Truman made themselves responsible for the development and first use of atomic weapons; the Atomic Energy Act now puts a comparable burden on the back of every President. And what has escaped statutory recognition has mostly been accreted into presidential common law, confirmed by custom, no less binding: the fireside chat and the press conference, for example, or the personally presented legislative programs, or personal campaigning in congressional elections.<br><br>In form all Presidents are leaders nowadays. In fact this guarantees no more than that they will be clerks. Everybody now expects the man inside the White House to do something about everything. Laws and customs now reflect acceptance of him as the great initiator, an acceptance quite as widespread at the Capitol as at his end of Pennsylvania Avenue. But such acceptance does not signify that all the rest of government is at his feet. It merely signifies that other men have found it practically impossible to do their jobs without assurance of initiatives from him. Service for themselves, not power for the President, has brought them to accept his leadership in form. They find his actions useful in their business. The transformation of his routine obligations testifies to their dependence on an active White House. A President, these days, is an invaluable clerk. His services are in demand all over Washington. His influence, however, is a very different matter. Laws and customs tell us little about leadership in fact.<br><br>IV<br><br>Why have our Presidents been honored with this clerkship? The answer is that no one else's services suffice. Our Constitution, our traditions, and our politics provide no better source for the initiatives a President can take. Executive officials need decisions, and political protection, and a referee for fights. Where are these to come from but the White House? Congressmen need an agenda from outside, something with high status to respond to or react against. What provides it better than the program of the President? Party politicians need a record to defend in the next national campaign. How can it be made except by "their" administration? Private persons with a public ax to grind may need a helping hand or they may need a grinding stone. In either case, who gives more satisfaction than a President? And outside the United States, in every country where our policies and postures influence home politics, there will be people needing just the "right" thing said and done or just the "wrong" thing stopped in Washington. What symbolizes Washington more nearly than the White House?<br><br>A modern President is bound to face demands for aid and service from five more or less distinguishable sources: from executive officialdom, from Congress, from his partisans, from citizens at large, and from abroad. The Presidency's clerkship is expressive of these pressures. In effect they are constituency pressures, and each President has five sets of constituents. The five are not distinguished by their membership; membership is obviously an overlapping matter. And taken one by one they do not match the man's electorate; one of them, indeed, is outside his electorate. They are distinguished, rather, by their different claims upon him. Initiatives are what they want, for five distinctive reasons. Since government and politics have offered no alternative, our laws and customs turn those wants into his obligations.<br><br>Why, then, is the President not guaranteed an influence commensurate with services performed? Constituent relations are relations of dependence. Everyone with any share in governing this country will belong to one (or two, or three) of his constituencies. Since everyone depends on him, why is he not assured of everyone's support? The answer is that no one else sits where he sits or sees quite as he sees; no one else feels the full weight of his obligations. Those obligations are a tribute to his unique place in our political system. But just because it is unique they fall on him alone. <i>The same conditions that promote his leadership in form preclude a guarantee of leadership in fact.</i> No man or group at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue shares his peculiar status in our government and politics. That is why his services are in demand. By the same token, though, the obligations of all other men are different from his own. His cabinet officers have departmental duties and constituents. His legislative leaders head congressional parties, one in either house. His national party organization stands apart from his official family. His political allies in the states need not face Washington or one another. The private groups that seek him out are not compelled to govern. And friends abroad are not compelled to run in our elections. Lacking his position and prerogatives, these men cannot regard his obligations as their own. They have their jobs to do; none is the same as his. As they perceive their duty they may find it right to follow him, in fact, or they may not. Whether they will feel obliged on their responsibility to do what he wants done remains an open question. That question serves to introduce this book.<br><br>Copyright � 1990 by Richard E.

He shows this concept blossoming around the world with striking results, from the burgeoning economies of India and China to the more mature societies of Europe and New England.

Most of the herbs are used in Chinese medicine, but a few belong to the Ayurvedic tradition. The first section of the book gives background on herbal traditions, risks to the future of herbalism, and conservation and global trade in medicinal plants. This section also gives general advice on cultivation in the nursery, garden, and field, and on harvesting, drying, storing, and shipping herbs, collecting and saving seeds, and selling herbs. The book then provides profiles of 79 herbs. Each herb entry gives a plant description, advice on propagation and planting, a list of suitable plant companions, and a brief summary of medicinal uses, plus notes on field production, pests and diseases, and harvest and yield. Each entry also includes a couple of color photos of plants in the field and the roots, flowers, or other parts when processed for medicinal use.</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Booklist-</strong></em><br><br>"Comprehensive" best describes Schafer's specialized resource. She begins, appropriately, with a discussion of small-scale cultivation as a way to protect the environment and be part of the international trade in medicinal plants. The growth of herbal trade parallels the increase in the number of Americans exploring acupuncture and other elements of traditional Chinese medicine, so this guide will meet the rising do-it-yourself interest in growing medicinal herbs. Schafer's easily understood instructions are accompanied by boxed inserts of important tips, charts and tables, and photographs. Most of the book is dedicated to 79 detailed herb profiles with growing information and medicinal uses. Also provided are plant and medicinal name cross-references; hardiness-zone maps with a China-U.S. latitude overlay; resources for herb seeds and plants; recommended readings, listings of websites, and herbal and conservation organizations; and an all-important glossary of horticultural, medicinal, and Chinese terms. This genuinely unusual, authoritative manual will likely be in brisk demand.</p><br><br><p>"For the practitioner of Chinese medicine, <em>The Chinese Medicinal Herb Farm</em> is a teacher, drawing us closer to the herbs we use. For the casual gardener, it is a handbook for growing fresh Chinese herbs as part of a healthy diet. For anyone who has an interest in growing their own Chinese herbs, Peg Schafer gives us a new reason to look forward to spring."<strong>--Andrew Ellis, author of <em>Notes from South Mountain: A Guide to Concentrated Herb Granules</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"Peg Schafer, the most experienced Chinese medicinal herb grower in North America, charts a new course in Chinese medicinal plant cultivation by providing the guidance needed to grow the most important of these herbs domestically. This book offers more than just cultivation tips, but also an assurance of proper plant identification, optimal growing and harvesting conditions, freshness of materials, and the ability to access Chinese medicinals with the lowest carbon footprint possible."<strong>--Roy Upton, Executive Director, American Herbal Pharmacopoeia</strong></p><br><br><p>"Peg Schafer understands in more ways than one that good health springs from the land. Herbs from the Chinese tradition perfectly complement more familiar healing plants. The concept of "regional medicine farms" resonates so well with the growing desire to eat more locally. But of course! We are what we eat, and that includes the medicinal plants that work with our bodies to create wholeness. Every plant person will instantly recognize the gift waiting within this book-Schafer shares many astute observations of how each plant garners medicinal oomph, what she calls the vital qi (chi) of each herb. And that's the right sort of inspiration to launch any thinking gardener!"<strong>--Michael Phillips, author of <em>The Holistic Orchard</em>, and co-author Nancy Phillips of <em>The Herbalist's Way</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"Peg Schafer is the best artisanal grower I know. For this book, she has distilled the knowledge of the small group who, over the past two decades, has pioneered North American production of Chinese medicinal herbs, and tested it through direct experience. This book clearly explains the whys as well as the how-tos, and delivers information into the eager hands of all perennial polyculturalists who will grow us a post-peak oil healthcare system; it is a gift to us all."<strong>--Jean Giblette, owner, High Falls Gardens and co-founder, LocalHerbs.org</strong></p><br><br><p>"This is by far the most detailed and thorough book that addresses the urgent issue of organic cultivation and processing of Chinese herbs. It will have a profound effect on future land use, herb availability, pesticide burdens, and sustainability in a field that is expanding rapidly around the world. I can't stress enough how valuable and rare this information is to practitioners and users of Chinese herbal medicine. I highly recommend this book for all TCM herbalists, as well as gardeners and farmers who want to learn the art of the organic cultivation of Chinese medicinals."<strong>--Bill Schoenbart, L.Ac., D.A.O.M</strong></p></p><h2>Healing Feelings...from Your Heart</h2><p>Did you know you have a &#34;heart of gold&#34;?

At first this made him feel guilty, until he realized that all around him fathers were pretending to do one thing, to feel one way, when in fact they felt and did all sorts of things, then engaged in what amounted to an extended cover-up.<br><br> Lewis decided to keep a written record of what actually happened immediately after the birth of each of his three children. This book is that record. But it is also something else: maybe the funniest, most unsparing account of ordinary daily household life ever recorded from the point of view of the man inside. The remarkable thing about this story isn&#x2019;t that Lewis is so unusual. It&#x2019;s that he is so typical. The only wonder is that his wife has allowed him to publish it. 3 photos</p><p><strong>Michael Lewis</strong> is the best-selling author of <em>Liar&#x2019;s Poker</em>, <em>Moneyball</em>, <em>The Blind Side</em>, <em>The Big Short</em>, and <em>The Undoing Project</em>. He lives in Berkeley, California, with his wife and three children.Lewis recounts the daily happenings of parenting his three children--from household activities to school to vacations. It&#39;s not that they&#39;re extraordinary or that he&#39;s some kind of superdad. It&#39;s that they&#39;re so ordinary, so typical. Any parent can identify. Dan John Miller is well suited to the work. He varies his tone and pacing, making the narration more of a conversation than a straight reading. Miller delivers the humor naturally, without making it sound like some kind of stand-up routine. His juvenile voices sound a little cartoonish, but few narrators can carry off that bit of audio magic. In sum, Miller&#39;s reading exactly suits the content and style of the writing.

A teacher in the lineage of Shunryu Suzuki, author of <i>Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</i>, she was the first female abbot of an American Zen center. She is greatly revered, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where she has lived and taught for many years. This, her long-awaited first book, is a collection of short teachings taken from her talks on the subject of boundlessness--the boundlessness that sees beyond our small, limited self to include all others. To live a boundless life she encourages living the vows prescribed by the Buddha and living life with the curiosity of a child. The short, stand-alone pieces can be dipped into whenever one is in need of inspiration.</p><p>Zenkei Blanche Hartman (1926&#x2013;2016) was a Soto Zen teacher in the lineage of Suzuki Roshi and a revered elder figure in American Zen. She spent two terms as abbot of the San Francisco Zen Center and was in fact the first woman abbot of a Zen center in America. She&#x2019;s an expert in rakusu-sewing (those bib-like things you see Zen practitioners wear that represent the Buddha&#x2019;s robe), and she's been particularly known for her attention to women&#x2019;s issues in Buddhism and Zen."A great Zen master gives us her total heart in this beautiful book of her teachings. She &#x2018;gives life to life,&#x2019; and in this way, gives humanity to humanity through her deep understanding of her life and our life. What a treasury of rare and earthly wisdom!"&#x2014;Joan Halifax, author of <i>Being with Dying</i><br><br>"Simple Zen, that makes you pause, appreciate; full of respect, kindhearted as a grandmother, and unpretentiously wise."&#x2014;Jack Kornfield author of <i>A Path with Heart</i><br><br>"These wise and compassionate words of Zenkei Blanche Hartman are grounded in forty-five years of continuous Zen practice. There is nothing superficial here. The basis of these talks is Zenkei Roshi&#x2019;s fundamental touchstone of zazen meditation and her interaction with countless Zen students over these many years. Take a look inside and treat yourself to the no-frills understanding of a truly mature person."&#x2014;Sojun Mel Weitsman, Abbot, Berkeley Zen Center<br><br>"Like so many other Zen students, my practice has been nourished by Zenkei&#x2019;s loving wisdom.

Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season's premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder.<p> Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders? </p><p> But Quidditch buffs need not go into mourning: we get our share of this great game at the World Cup. Attempting to go incognito as Muggles, 100,000 witches and wizards converge on a "nice deserted moor." As ever, Rowling magicks up the details that make her world so vivid, and so comic. Several spectators' tents, for instance, are entirely unquotidian. One is a minipalace, complete with live peacocks; another has three floors and multiple turrets. And the sports paraphernalia on offer includes rosettes "squealing the names of the players" as well as "tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves." Needless to say, the two teams are decidedly different, down to their mascots. Bulgaria is supported by the beautiful veela, who instantly enchant everyone--including Ireland's supporters--over to their side. Until, that is, thousands of tiny cheerleaders engage in some pyrotechnics of their own: "The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field."</p><p> Long before her fourth installment appeared, Rowling warned that it would be darker, and it's true that every exhilaration is equaled by a moment that has us fearing for Harry's life, the book's emotions running as deep as its dangers. Along the way, though, she conjures up such new characters as Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, a Dark Wizard catcher who may or may not be getting paranoid in his old age, and Rita Skeeter, who beetles around Hogwarts in search of stories. (This <i>Daily Prophet</i> scoop artist has a Quick-Quotes Quill that turns even the most innocent assertion into tabloid innuendo.) And at her bedazzling close, Rowling leaves several plot strands open, awaiting book 5. This fan is ready to wager that the author herself is part veela--her pen her wand, her commitment to her world complete.

He traveled to Black Africa twice. He reported about the wealthy, multi-cultural trading centers of the African East coast, such as Mombasa and Kilwa, and the warm hospitality he experienced in Mogadishu. He also visited the courts of Mansa Musa and neighboring states during its period of prosperity from mining and the trans-Saharan trade. He wrote disapprovingly of sexual integration in families and of a &#x201c;hostility toward the white man.&#x201d; Ibn Battuta&#x2019;s description is a unique document of the high culture, pride, and independence of Black African states in the fourteenth century. This book is one of the most important documents about Black Africa written by a non-European Medieval historian. The new appendices include reports by contemporary Arab travelers who witnessed events described by Ibn Battuta, such as Ibn Khaldun, al-Maqqari, Ibn al-Dawadari and Al-Maqrizi. New foreword and bibliography by Ross Dunn. New and expanded appendices.</p><p>Everybody knows the names of European explorers such as Marco Polo and Christopher Columbus, but how many have heard of Ibn Battuta? This intrepid North African scholar first set out for Mecca in the year 1325 A.D. and became so smitten with life on the road that he just kept traveling for the next 29 years. Though Mecca was the object of most of his journeys, Ibn Battuta took different routes each time and thus managed to visit such far-flung places as the Maldive Islands, northern Turkey, and southern China. Ibn Battuta twice traveled south of the Sahara, once visiting the coast of East Africa during a voyage back to Morocco from Arabia, and once journeying to Mali by camel caravan--his last recorded adventure. As with all his journeys, Ibn Battuta kept a detailed account of the places he visited and the people he met. In <i>Ibn Battuta in Black Africa</i>, editors Noel King and Said Hamdun have selected and translated many of Ibn Battuta's writings about his travels in Africa. Anyone interested in the precolonial cultures that thrived in sub-Saharan Africa will find this highly personal account of the private lives and public institutions of the peoples of 14th-century East and West Africa fascinating reading.About Noel Q.

Tiny white lights twinkled in the treetops as candles glowed on the cloth-covered tables around the provisional outdoor ballroom. A sea of Stetsons bobbed as a country music band played. The sound of clinking crystal glasses mingled with the hum of cheerful voices. It was a beautiful spring evening.<br><br>It should have been a perfect night since the party was to celebrate the first of his six daughters' engagements. All he'd ever wanted was for his daughters to be happy. That Olivia was the first to marry didn't surprise him. He'd seen the way she'd looked at the wrangler the first day he'd come to work on the ranch. Cooper Barnett wouldn't have been his choice for her, but what did he know about love other than it was blind?<br><br>He raised his own glass in a silent salute. No matter what happened after tonight, he couldn't have been more proud of his daughters, or as they were known around Beartooth, Montana, the Hamilton girls.<br><br>God knew he'd spoiled them after their mother died. In the twenty-two years since, he'd been over-protective, he'd be the first to admit it. There were stories that he'd met their dates on the front porch with a shotgun. He smiled. Although untrue, it had taken courageous young men to even dare to ask his girls out.<br><br>It was his fault, no doubt, that all six had grown into headstrong, hard-to-please women. Buckmaster sighed, although he truthfully saw nothing wrong with that. His girls had grown up with the run of one of the largest ranches in their part of the state. They had wanted for nothing, he'd seen to that.<br><br>Except for the mother they'd lost.<br><br>He took another drink to wash down the bitterness.<br><br>"One of our girls is getting married, Sarah," he whispered into the warm spring night. "You missed it all. Now you won't even be there to see Olivia get married." He let out a curse, furious with Sarah for leaving him. Even more furious with himself because he still ached for her after all these years, as if he'd lost a limb.<br><br>He didn't want to think about her. Not tonight. Focusing on the party instead, he surveyed the growing crowd and spotted his oldest daughter, Ainsley, gathered with four of her sisters near the bar. She'd been ten at the time of her mother's death and had become a little mother to the others. She even looked like her mother, a blonde beauty. Except that Ainsley was much stronger than her mother had been. She was the one everyone depended on, himself included.<br><br>His gaze moved to Kat, the daughter who'd taken after him the most. Strong willed, Kat had gotten his dark hair and his gray eyes. She looked rugged and unapproachable even as pretty as she was.<br><br>She'd been eight when Sarah had died. Kat, who'd become a photographer, was always in trouble growing up. He'd watched her pull away from the family first by becoming a vegetarian and demanding he quit raising cattle, and later by spending less time at the ranch and more time rebelling in every possible way. He worried about her and often wondered what it would take to make her happy.<br><br>He let his gaze take in the fraternal twins, Harper and Cassidy, and smiled. They were blonde, blue-eyed and adorable. He still thought of them as his babies since they'd only been a few months old when they'd lost their mother. They were both still in college and only home for their sister's engagement party.<br><br>As he found Bo in the crowd below, he realized she was the daughter who worried him even more than Kat. Kat was defiant and obstinate. Bo was the secretive one. She had been five when Sarah died. Even back then, Bo was the quiet one who seemed to move through the house like a ghost. Green-eyed with sandy-blond hair and freckles, she was also the smart one.<br><br>To his surprise, it had been Bo who'd wanted to take over the charity he'd started in their mother's name. The Sarah Hamilton Foundation had been a sentimental gesture he'd regretted the moment he'd found out the truth about Sarah's <em>accident</em> the night she died.<br><br>With concern, he now watched Bo down a glass of champagne as if it were water. He could tell it was far from her first. Something was going on with her. This wasn't the first time he'd noticed. He didn't know what it was and he'd been afraid to ask. Maybe he'd ask Ainsley, but not tonight.<br><br>He looked through the crowd for Olivia, his blue-eyed brunette, but didn't see her. Sarah had been a lot like Olivia&#x2014;headstrong, spoiled rotten and too beautiful for her own good. Cooper, he feared, was too much like he'd been, stubborn and uncompromising. He and Sarah had been so young, and Olivia was only twenty-five...<br><br>At the thought of history repeating itself&#x2014;<br><br>He washed away that terrifying thought with a gulp of Scotch. Behind him, he heard the balcony door open.<br><br>"I thought you might be here," his wife of fifteen years said. Angelina Broadwater Hamilton glanced at the glass in his hand. "People are asking about you downstairs."<br><br>Influential people in their political circle, people who had made him one of the youngest senators ever elected from Montana. People who could make him president, something he knew Angelina yearned for even more than he did.<br><br>Now, it appeared that there was a very good chance the presidency was his for the taking. He had an excellent voting record and, while a conservative, he was moderate enough to gain respect from both parties. He'd made a lot of friends on both sides of the fence. All the work that Angelina had done had paid off.<br><br>While he had always been ambitious, Buckmaster believed in his heart that he could help the country. He would be a good president. He would make Montana proud.<br><br>Below him, he saw his brother-in-law, Lane Broadwater, working the crowd at the party. In his midthirties, Lane was blond like his sister with the same blue eyes. Although he was eleven years younger, the two looked more like fraternal twins. Angelina had talked him into hiring her brother to handle the campaign when he'd run for senator. He'd been skeptical at first about Lane's abilities, but he'd proven himself to be good at the job. Also he was enough like his sister that he went after whatever it was he wanted. Lane and Angelina wanted to put him in the White House. They'd proven to be very good at what they did.<br><br>He drained his glass and smiled as he turned to her. "Then we should get downstairs at once."<br><br>Angelina eyed him, clearly unsure if he was being sarcastic. She'd never been able to tell, but it didn't matter. He hadn't married her for her astuteness. While she was a beautiful blonde, tall, willowy, with a face that could have been carved from porcelain, he'd married her for her name. The Broadwater connection had definitely helped put him in the Senate and made him even richer. It would put him in the White House.<br><br>He could laugh about it now, but fifteen years ago some people were under the misconception that he'd married her so she could help raise his six daughters. Angelina wasn't mother material.<br><br>Fifteen years ago, he also hadn't particularly needed a wife&#x2014;not in the practical sense&#x2014;when he'd met Angelina. Which was good because there was also nothing domestic about her. He'd hired a staff to run the house and take care of his children since he spent a great deal of his time in Washington.<br><br>Angelina, though, was queen of her realm when it came to throwing parties. She attracted the right people, the kind who had made Buckmaster Hamilton one of the most powerful men in Montana.<br><br>Now, Angelina took the empty glass from his hand, smiling as she laid it aside for the staff to take care of later. Then looping her arm through his, she said, "You look very handsome tonight, Mr. Hamilton. Ready for our grand entrance?"<br><br>"Why not?" He smiled, though most women would have seen through it. Angelina never looked past the surface. Because of that, she didn't know about the dark shadows he sensed at the edge of their lives. She couldn't imagine any problems that Buckmaster Hamilton couldn't fix. But then again, she didn't really know him.<br><br>Cooper Barnett walked along the side of the house to the ballroom floor that had been built for the occasion. Everyone who was anyone was here, which meant he didn't know most of the guests.<br><br>But he had to admit, it was some party from the tiny sparkling lights to the bubbly champagne and the imported caviar Buckmaster had flown in just that morning. No expense had been spared. It was the Hamilton way. Whatever it cost, money was never an issue.<br><br>He caught his reflection in a mirror as he passed through the house, and he straightened his tie. Wouldn't his family be surprised to see him now? He looked nothing like the old Cooper Barnett; he still felt a lot like the old one&#x2014;except in nicer clothes. It was that old one who worried him.<br><br><em>You don't belong here.</em> Worse, he feared that a lot of people at this party knew it. He shoved the thought away as he exited the house and walked among the crowd outside, anxious to find his fianc�e. Stars twinkled overhead. A light breeze swayed the nearby pines and music filled the air. The Ham-iltons couldn't have ordered a more beautiful night. Even the weather did what Buckmaster wanted, he thought with a wry smile.<br><br>Then he saw his bride-to-be and forgot all about his future father-in-law and the old Cooper Barnett. His heart did a little stutter-kick in his chest. Damn but Livie Hamilton was breathtaking tonight. She wore a burgundy-red dress that accentuated her rich olive skin and contrasted perfectly with her long dark hair. He still couldn't believe she'd fallen in love with him. How had he gotten so lucky?<br><br>Not that she wasn't a spitfire who fought him at every turn. Also he'd done his best not to fall in love with her. He'd been warned about the Hamilton girls and he'd wanted nothing to do with her.<br><br>When he fell, though, he'd fallen hard. He wouldn't admit it to her even at gunpoint, but her independent, mule-headed stubbornness and determination were part of her charm. But she was a Hamilton and that came with its problems.<br><br>He was headed for her when she saw him. Her face lit, making his heart take off at a dead run. The band broke into Livie's favorite song, just as he had requested. It was sappy, but when he saw her smile of recognition, it was all worth it.<br><br>"You look...amazing," he said, taking her in with his gaze, then his arms.<br><br>She smiled up at him, her blue eyes wide and luminous. "You don't look so bad yourself. You clean up nice, cowboy."<br><br>He pulled her out onto the dance floor, drawing her in closer. As he nuzzled her neck, he caught the scent of light citrus. Desire almost buckled his knees. Overhead, starlight glittered down on them from Montana's big sky. The night really was perfect.<br><br>"I am the luckiest man alive," he said as he drew back to look at her. He'd never understand why she'd fallen in love with him. If only she wasn't a Hamilton, he thought, and shoved the thought away. He wouldn't let anything ruin this night.<br><br>He'd never believed in luck. He'd gotten where he was through hard work. But he was afraid to jinx this, afraid he didn't deserve this woman, deserve any of this&#x2014;and he knew he could blame his father for that.<br><br>Ralph Barnett had told him from the time he was a boy that he wasn't worth two cents and would never amount to anything. He's spent most of his twenty-eight years trying to prove the man wrong. But there was still that part of him that didn't believe he deserved anything, especially happiness.<br><br>"I'm the lucky one," Livie said.<br><br>Cooper pulled her closer, leaning down to whisper, "I love you," against her hair. He relished the soft sweet moan she uttered in response. He ached with a need for her. The two of them had been so busy they had hardly seen each other for weeks. Once this shindig was over, he couldn't wait to get her alone.<br><br>As the song ended, she drew back to look at him, her gaze locking with his. He lost himself in her sky-blue eyes. Her dark hair floated around her bare shoulders, making his fingers long to bury themselves in it. No woman had ever made him feel like this and he knew, after Livie, no other woman ever could.<br><br>"I love you, Coop. Remember that always." She said it with such force that he felt a niggling of worry. She looked a little pale, he thought, and recalled that the few times he'd seen her over the past few weeks she hadn't been herself.<br><br>He'd been busy working on the ranch, getting it ready for when she moved in after they were married. Livie had also been busy, taking care of the wedding plans. He would have been happy to elope, but Buckmaster Hamilton wasn't having that. His first daughter to marry was going to have a huge wedding, no expense spared.<br><br>Cooper had gone along with it, knowing it was important to Livie. But he'd dug in his heels when it came to her father helping them financially, which had been a bone of contention between them, among other things.<br><br>He would also have gladly gone for a longer engagement, giving him time to finish the house he was building for them on his ranch. But Livie wasn't good at waiting for anything. It was her impulsiveness that he loved&#x2014;but it also caused him concern. She often acted without thinking of the consequences.<br><br>Like last winter when, after a fight, she'd taken off with a storm coming and ended up in a ditch. Even though she swore her injury was minor, she hadn't been the same since, he thought now.<br><br>"Is everything all right, Livie?" he asked, his heart suddenly in his throat.</p><h2>Savage Conversations</h2><p>May 1875: Mary Todd Lincoln is addicted to opiates and tried in a Chicago court on charges of insanity. Entered into evidence is Ms. Lincoln&#x2019;s claim that every night a Savage Indian enters her bedroom and slashes her face and scalp. She is swiftly committed to Bellevue Place Sanitarium. Her hauntings may be a reminder that in 1862, President Lincoln ordered the hanging of thirty-eight Dakotas in the largest mass execution in United States history. No one has ever linked the two events&#x2015;until now. <em>Savage Conversations</em> is a daring account of a former first lady and the ghosts that tormented her for the contradictions and crimes on which this nation is founded.</p><p>LeAnne Howe (Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma) is a poet, fiction writer, playwright, and filmmaker.

She is the Eidson Distinguished Professor in American Literature in English at the University of Georgia, Athens.&#x201c;I am stunned by the beauty, humor, and originality of this book. It feels as new as the Garden of Eden, except Adam is really the Holy Trinity of the Three Stooges, and Eve is a genius Native woman poet-professor. For years, I've hoped that we Native writers will build a twenty-first century literary rocket and blast off into brand new space. LeAnne Howe (along with Adam, Eve, the Three Stooges, The Lone Ranger and Tonto, Crazy Horse and Custer, and the entire cast of Gilligan's Island, along with Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, and five or six smiling Indian elders) has done exactly that. This book is new.&#x201d; &#x2015;Sherman Alexie <br><br>&#x201c;LeAnne Howe&#x2019;s Evidence of Red is a complex and exhilarating symphony, with passages of mythic sweep, swatches of history, and poignant memoir&#x2015;held together with her inimitable take-no-prisoners comic sense.&#x201d; &#x2015;Ken McCullough <br><br>&#x201c;How does she do it? Cross Rocky Horror Picture Show with War and Peace in a voice that sings America&#x2019;s song as deeply as the best musical poetry of Walt Whitman? But no, Howe&#x2019;s voice is so utterly unique, comparisons can&#x2019;t do her justice. <i>Evidence of Red</i> succeeds on every level: emotional, intellectual, spiritual, sensual, political. This volume is a gift from a rich place&#x2015;wise, generous, exciting, and completely fresh.&#x201d; &#x2015;Susan Power <br><br>&#x201c;LeAnne Howe&#x2019;s Evidence of Red: Poems and Prose cracks open the strictures of literature with passion, enthusiasm, verve, and style!

You haven&#x2019;t read Howe yet until you experience her ranging in <i>Evidence of Red</i> from oral story style, poetic verse, fiction, dramatic script, even a bit of a musical, take your pick. And then let her lead you into history, intrigue, comedy and comic insight, even mystery, yes, as she impels you and other readers toward decolonization with attitude!

Daniel held a black belt, second dan, in hapkido, had a black belt in tae kwon do, and a black belt in tai chi&#x2014;the combat martial art, not the pretty forms that hippies and old people do on beaches at sunrise. (Not that I had anything against pretty martial arts, hippies, or old people. I&#x2019;d outlived all of the people who were alive when I was born, so I was old. Real old.)</p><p>Daniel hadn&#x2019;t competed in years, however, believing that competition was for sissies and martial arts were for fighting and killing. He was probably a lot more dangerous than most people who did compete. And right now he was on his back on the practice mat, trying to figure out if his lungs still worked. It had been only about thirty seconds since I&#x2019;d thrown him to the floor, knocking the breath out of him, but that can seem like a lot of time when you aren&#x2019;t breathing.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not kissing him,&#x201d; Eli Younger said, still gasping, sweat dripping off him onto the mat in little splats. My Beast and I had been sparring with both of them. Admittedly, it was a little too wound heavy to be just sparring, but testosterone and the urge to defeat the skinny girl were powerful motivators, keeping them coming back for more when they should have stayed down. And Beast had been having fun.</p><p>&#x201c;Artificial respiration isn&#x2019;t technically kissing,&#x201d; I said, watching as Daniel fought back the natural panic of the air starved, arching his back, stretching his throat, trying to force open his airway.</p><p>&#x201c;Still not kissing him. Sorry, bro,&#x201d; Eli said, toeing Daniel&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Been nice knowin&#x2019; you.&#x201d;</p><p>Daniel sucked in a breath that sounded like rubber bicycle tubing being stretched out by a couple of disgruntled sumo wrestlers. Strained. Very strained. Eli laughed. Faster than most humans can manage, Daniel whipped his arm around, his fist catching Eli on the outer knee joint. If Eli hadn&#x2019;t already been bending into the direction of the hit, his knee would have buckled and Eli would have needed a brace or vamp blood to heal. Daniel was powerful, even flat on his back.</p><p>As it was, the guys rolled across each other like high school wrestlers, but punching and stabbing with fingers, kneeing below the belt. They separated, rolled to their feet, and engaged again. All I needed was popcorn and a beer and it would have been perfect. Delighted to sit this one out, I slid down the wall to the wood floor, my sweaty back to the wall, knees bent in a half lotus, and relaxed. The guys were really going at it, fists, kicks, sweat flinging, with a little blood mixed in. I had to wonder if something was bothering them, because this was starting to look real.</p><p>My sensei&#x2019;s style was perfect for me, because I had always studied mixed disciplines and never went for any belt. I trained to stay alive, using a fast, violent amalgam of styles geared to the total annihilation of an attacker. My fighting style had best been described as dirty. Daniel and Eli, my partner in Yellowrock Securities, both fought dirty. I winced as Eli took a boxer&#x2019;s blow straight to his chin and wobbled on his feet. But either he recovered fast or it was only a feint, because he kicked out, catching Daniel in the solar plexus. In fighters&#x2019; terms it wasn&#x2019;t a low blow, but since I had just hit Sensei there, it wasn&#x2019;t exactly sweet either.</p><p>Daniel skipped away, his breathing pained. I wondered whether he&#x2019;d broken a rib.</p><p>The dojo was in the back room of a small jewelry store on St. Louis Street, the store specializing in faceted gems, vintage styles and settings, and real antique pieces. The dojo was down a narrow service alley, thirty inches wide, damp, and dim, and was open to the public only after store hours. I was one of a select few students Daniel saw during the day. I had my own key.</p><p>Eli took a fast series of punches to the ribs, bounced off a white-painted wall across from me and into the mirrored back wall. Daniel nearly got his boy parts crushed by a kick, but he jumped back, caught one of Eli&#x2019;s ankles, and twisted it hard and fast, putting torqueing pressure on the knee. Eli was expecting the move and leaped off the floor into a twirl and kicked Daniel in the side of the neck with his other foot. They both went down. Daniel out for the count. Idiots. Eli was wheezing with pain. The hand he supported himself with had left a bloody print on the mirror.</p><p>The long room had hardwood floors, two white-painted walls&#x2014;one now stained with blood&#x2014;one mirrored wall (ditto), and one wall with French doors that looked out over a typical New Orleans&#x2013;style enclosed courtyard planted with tropical and semitropical plants. Three cats, tails twitching, lounged on a low brick-stucco wall near the splashing fountain, which was designed in the fashion of a mountain stream, with the small pool at the bottom filled with plants. The cats, looking bored and hot, were watching the humans fight. The enclosed courtyard was surrounded by two- and three-story buildings and was overlooked by wrought-iron galleries dripping with potted vines and flowering plants. Sensei lived upstairs in one of the apartments, and he usually dropped down using a rappelling rope and climbing gear. I had a feeling he&#x2019;d be going back up the hard way, one slow step at a time.</p><p>Since Daniel was rolling over, marginally awake, and it looked as if the fight was over, I shifted my weight and clapped slowly, the sound ringing brightly off the unadorned walls. &#x201c;Danny boy, I think you got your butt beat,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d; He winced as he rolled to his backside and stood upright, stretching muscles that had to have deep bruises. &#x201c;But it took two of you. Tag team.&#x201d; Daniel was average height, had muscles like rolls of barbed wire and a face no one would remember for two seconds. A man no one would notice.</p><p>Silent, working out the kinks, he walked around the room, bare feet solid, body as balanced as a walking tree, looking Eli and me over, considering.</p><p>I grinned at my partner and said, &#x201c;Yeah, but I&#x2019;m still holding back. A lot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are not holding back,&#x201d; Daniel said, disbelief etching his face. &#x201c;Seriously? Still?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bro, she is absolutely still holding back.&#x201d; Eli bent his injured knees, testing for damage that might need more than ice, elevation, anti-inflammatory meds, and time to heal. &#x201c;When she really lets go, it&#x2019;s nothing like human speed or human strength. She&#x2019;d twist your lil&#x2019; bobblehead right off that skinny neck.&#x201d;</p><p>I managed to keep the discomfort off my face. I still wasn&#x2019;t used to part of the world knowing that I was a supernat, and was even less accustomed to hearing it spoken of like it was no big deal. It had been my secret for so long that it still <i>felt</i> like a big deal. But Eli was right. If I let go with Beast-strength and -speed, I could do some damage. Once he knew I&#x2019;d been holding back, my training and sparring sessions with Daniel had changed. Now he pushed the normal human boundaries, trying to see what my limits were. There were two problems with that: I didn&#x2019;t really know what my boundaries were, especially with the newfound ability to fold or bubble time, and my limits seemed to be changing now that my Beast and I had soul-bonded.</p><p>Daniel tossed a dry towel to Eli and the two guys dried off, still trash-talking.</p><p>I ignored them and pushed off the floor to my feet, seeing my reflection in the long wall mirror. I was moving a little differently now, smoother, more catlike, limbs and joints and muscles rolling and balanced and effortless. It was freaky. In the last month or so, my eyes had started to glow more often as Beast stared out at the world through my vision. Again, freaky. I still had my long black hair, currently braided close to my head, and the copper skin of my tribe&#x2014;<i>Chelokay</i>, or <i>Tsalagi</i>, the Cherokee. Also known as The People.</p><p>I caught a towel tossed my way and wiped down. Showers would have to wait until we got back to the house. The dojo wasn&#x2019;t set up for lockers and shower stalls.</p><p>Outside, the fountain tinkled in the enclosed courtyard. A cat made a <i>mrowr</i> sound, probably telling Daniel that it was suppertime. Cats could be demanding that way. I know. My Beast is a mountain lion and she&#x2019;s big on being fed, though she prefers her food freshly caught and slaughtered by her killing teeth.</p><p>From the pile of gear on the floor, I heard both of our phones singing to us&#x2014;both playing &#x201c;Hit Me with Your Best Shot,&#x201d; by Pat Benatar. It was the ringtone for Alex, the other Younger brother, and the tech partner of Yellowrock Securities. If he was ringing both lines, this couldn&#x2019;t be good.</p><p>I bent and caught up both cells, underhand throwing Eli&#x2019;s to him and opening the Kevlar cover to mine. Eli said, &#x201c;Go ahead.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get to suckhead HQ. Something&#x2019;s going down.&#x201d;</p><p>Eli and I grabbed up our gobags and trotted from the dojo, into the alley, moving fast. I gave a single wave to Daniel as the door shut behind me. I had a glimpse of Sensei, still standing against the wall, fists on his hips, looking better than Eli&#x2019;s opponents usually did. I knew he wanted to go with us&#x2014;he had been hinting it&#x2014;but dealing with vamps took practice and a lot of emotional and verbal restraint. I wasn&#x2019;t sure how restrained Daniel would be if a male vamp came on to him for dinner and a date. Vamps were a lot less reticent about sexual matters than most humans, and Daniel gave out strong, uncompromising hetero signals, a challenge to any vamp. Eli had quickly learned to fob them off with a laugh and a polite refusal, but Daniel struck me as the belt-him-first-and-stalk-away-mad-second kind. Which could get him dead, fast.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re on speaker,&#x201d; Eli said to Alex as the dojo door closed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too early to be a vamp problem. An attacker would fry.&#x201d; I closed my cell and listened.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing on the outside cameras. It&#x2019;s inside. At the ballroom.&#x201d;</p><p>Vamps could maneuver inside most of vamp central, the windows being long and narrow and newly covered by electric shutters. I took a breath to speak and got a lungful of alley stink that was enough to bowl over an elephant. It smelled of urine&#x2014;some of it not from cats&#x2014;and all of it baking in the summer heat and humidity. I said, &#x201c;Gimme details, because I&#x2019;m not heading back to vamp HQ to settle a love spat or to get in the middle of a long-standing feud between vamp factions.&#x201d; There were too many vamps in the relatively small space, and there had been more than a few violent incidents. Vamp-on-vamp action was outside my job requirements as long as no humans got caught in the cross fire.</p><p>&#x201c;Got nothing that makes sense,&#x201d; Alex said. &#x201c;Still pulling up camera footage. But it&#x2019;s bloody and it&#x2019;s bigger than the usual fanghead altercation.&#x201d;</p><p>Still moving at speed, we emerged from the alley, clanged the gate shut, and made it to the SUV, with Eli beeping the vehicle open. The trapped heat exploded out. We opened all the doors to let it air, which gave us time to take in the scenery. Traffic clogged the streets in the French Quarter so badly that we might not be able to get out of the parking spot unless someone was looking for one and let us out so they could get in. It was bumper-to-bumper gridlock. I&#x2019;d be glad when my Harley was repaired and I could again weave through the New Orleans traffic. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re gonna hafta hoof it to HQ, Alex,&#x201d; Eli said, &#x201c;but we&#x2019;re not going in wearing street clothes. We&#x2019;ll change here. Give us details as they firm.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Copy. Better you than me in this heat, dude.&#x201d;</p><p>Eli got behind the wheel and synced up our cells to the vehicle. I took the backseat and started gearing up&#x2014;leathers, weapons, boots. Not easy in the backseat of an overheated SUV with windows tinted vamp-black, even one as roomy as the brand-spanking-new one Leo had provided for my use. Eli turned on the cab lights and the AC, but it would take forever to cool off. I shook out a handful of baby powder and tossed the container to Eli, both of us liberally powdering down the sweat and sliding the leathers over our limbs as Alex began to give us the particulars.</p><p>&#x201c;Looks like it started in the sub-four basement about three minutes ago. Two fangheads fighting over a human woman. She&#x2019;s hurt. Del sent down reinforcements, but they got caught up in it and now it&#x2019;s a brawl.&#x201d;</p><p>Eli spat a curse under his breath, sliding on his new, high-tech combat boots and yanking on the laces. He had a point. Injured humans meant we had no choice but to intervene.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s getting nasty. Sending you vid now.&#x201d;</p><p>On the SUV video screen, we had a clear view of a sub-four hallway and about ten vamps. It was a bloody mess, not abnormal for vamps fighting, but weird to be happening before dusk, when most older vamps were sleepy or sleeping, and the young ones were out cold, often unable to be roused.</p><p>&#x201c;That looks wrong,&#x201d; I said of the fight. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not sure why.&#x201d; I checked the loads of my weapons and slid them into the oversized gobag. We were licensed to carry in Louisiana, but no one wanted to get detained if a hot, sweaty cop, stuck in traffic, saw us jog by.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. They look&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. stumble-y. Like <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> but faster,&#x201d; Eli said.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it. Vamps are graceful, and these are klutzes. I&#x2019;m ready,&#x201d; I said, strapping on my thigh rig.</p><p>The SUV&#x2019;s engine went silent and we slid from the dark interior into the humidity. It was like being hit in the face with a soaking-wet, wrecking-ball-sized sponge. Eli beeped the SUV locked, and we reactivated our cells and started down the sidewalk, moving fast.</p><p><i>Holy crap.</i> We had to <i>jog</i> in this heat?</p><p>As if reading my mind, Eli called back, &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll put hair on your chest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m afraid of.&#x201d; Inside me, Beast chuffed and sent an image of my half-Beast shape, covered in Beast pelt. I didn&#x2019;t have the breath to reply, not in this heat, and just kept jogging, the late-day summer sun like a steam torch on my exposed skin. I followed Eli down back alleys and, once, through a T-shirt and tourist-kitsch business, out the back, through the courtyard, into the back door of a restaurant, and out the front onto the street on the other side. No one stopped us, but I&#x2019;d bet we&#x2019;d end up on someone&#x2019;s YouTube channel somewhere.</p><p>To Alex, I said, &#x201c;I know Del is in charge, but notify Bruiser that something&#x2019;s transpiring at HQ. Just in case.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Copy,&#x201d; Alex said, his voice toneless enough to make my skin itch.</p><p>Bruiser was my&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. something. <i>Boyfriend</i> was too high school, <i>lover</i> was too sex-specific, <i>significant</i> <i>other</i> seemed more long-term and stable than what we might be starting to have. So <i>my</i> <i>something</i> was the best I could do. But he was also the former primo of the Master of the City of New Orleans, and Del, while capable, might need some backup. Informing him was not the same thing as calling for Bruiser&#x2019;s help like said high schooler. Or at least I didn&#x2019;t think it was. Having a &#x201c;my something&#x201d; wasn&#x2019;t exactly common for me.</p><p>We rounded the corner, approaching vamp central from an oblique angle, not one I ...</p></p><h2>Blood Lure (Anna Pigeon)</h2><p><b>In this mystery in Nevada Barr&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i> bestselling series, District Park Ranger Anna Pigeon is betrayed by nature itself, as a most unnatural evil stalks its prey in the pristine West...<br><br></b>Straddling the border between Montana and Canada lies the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park&#x2014;Anna&#x2019;s home away from home when she is sent on a cross-training assignment to study grizzly bears. Along with bear researcher Joan Rand and a volatile, unpredictable teenage boy, Anna hikes the back country, seeking signs of bear. But the tables are turned on their second night out, when one of the beasts comes looking for them. Daybreak finds the boy missing, a camper mutilated, and Anna caught in a grip of fear, painfully aware that her lifelong bond with nature has inexplicably snapped...</p><p>Park ranger Anna Pigeon, the fortyish heroine of Barr's popular series, is back, tracking grizzlies through the unforgiving landscape of Glacier National Park as part of a scientific investigation that's outlined with more detail than anyone who's not totally fascinated by these awesome animals will care about. In fact, the description of what actually goes into the lures set to attract the bears so they can be tagged and counted is guaranteed to rumble the strongest stomach--but that's just the back story in this newest Pigeon adventure. When the mutilated body of the stepmother of one of the bear trackers turns up in a remote corner of the park, and it becomes clear that she met death at the hands of a human rather than the claws of a grizzly, Anna goes on the hunt for the killer.<p> Barr's strength is in depicting the natural surroundings in which her heroine finds inspiration, solace, and comfort, and she limns the gorgeous landscape of Glacier with consummate skill. But her plotting leaves much to be desired, and when she finally reveals the killer's identity, motivation, and especially his accomplice, the discriminating reader may be tempted to throw this book at the nearest teddy bear. The trick ending is too much to stomach, unless you're a grizzly who'll eat (almost) anything. Up to that point, however, there's much to appeal to Barr's fans: another beautifully drawn portrait of a piece of America's vanishing wilderness and a few hours in the company of an appealingly cranky heroine whose appreciation of it knows no bounds. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Formerly an actress and a park ranger,&nbsp;<b>Nevada Barr&nbsp;</b>is now&nbsp;the award-winning,&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author of the Anna Pigeon mysteries and numerous other books and short stories.

And yet, just before Crystal names the criminal mastermind involved, he's shot dead in his seat.</p><p> With a new murder case on his hands and a lazy captain at the helm of the police department, the keen and clever Constable Twitten and his colleague Sargent Jim Brunswick set out to solve the decade-old mystery of the Aldersgate Stick-Up. As the partners venture deep into the criminal underworld that lies beneath Brighton's holiday-happy veneer, they begin to discover a criminal conspiracy that dates back decades. But will Brunswick and Twitten be able to foil the mastermind, or will Crystal's death become just another unsolved crime in this seemingly peaceful seaside city?</p><p> With her characteristic wit, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Lynne Truss introduces readers to a cast of eccentric policeman and scheming criminals in a drolly delightful mystery you won't want to miss.</p></p><p><b>Lynne Truss</b> is a celebrated author, screenwriter, columnist, and broadcaster.

Leffler</b>, Stettinius Professor of American History at the University of Virginia, is the author <i>The Specter of Communism </i>(H&amp;W, 1994) and <i>A Preponderance of Power</i>.<i> </i>He lives in Charlottesville.<b>Excerpt</b>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The Cold War was a struggle for the very soul of mankind,&#x201d; former president George H. W. Bush wrote a few years ago. &#x201c;It was a struggle for a way of life.&#x201d;1<br>A decade ago, when I began work on this book, I would not have thought that I would come to view the Cold War in this manner. In 1989 and 1990, when I was finishing a book on the Truman administration&#x2019;s national security policies, I had been stunned by contemporary developments. Free governments arose in Eastern Europe. The Berlin wall came down. Germany was unified. Soviet-American competition in the third world abated. The Cold War ended. I had never imagined that these events would occur in my lifetime. Less than a decade before, the Cold War seemed to be entering a deep freeze. After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, in December 1979, relations between the United States and the Soviet Union appeared more ominously hostile than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Responsible officials talked and wrote about waging and winning nuclear wars. People in Moscow and Washington read articles about surprise attacks. Ideological foes inspired by malicious intentions were alleged to be on the prowl, seeking to take advantage of propitious moments to gain a preponderance of power. If officials were not vigilant&#x2014;the same language was used in Moscow as well as in Washington&#x2014;the adversary would employ its military power for blackmail. Concessions would lead to worse concessions. Allies would lose faith, clients would feel betrayed, the world balance of power would be upset, and vital security interests would be impaired. Leaders in Moscow and Washington never tired of telling their people that their way of life was at stake. The Cold War, it seemed, would last indefinitely or end in catastrophe.<br>Consequently, most of us were astonished by the turn of events when, in the half dozen years between 1985 and 1991, power in the international system was reconfigured and an ideological struggle that had engulfed the globe for almost a half century was ended.<br>How did this happen? Powerful men, Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, had dramatically altered the course of history. But if they were able to do this so decisively, I began to wonder whether other leaders might have done likewise. Why, after all, did the Cold War last as long as it did? Might there have been other moments, other opportunities when the conflict could have been resolved? If men so different ideologically as Reagan and Gorbachev could muster the will and the ability to change the Soviet-American relationship, might their predecessors have done so? Had they ever thought of doing so? If so, why did they fail, and Reagan and Gorbachev succeed?<br>Tantalizing documents and memoirs from Moscow, Budapest, Berlin, Warsaw, Prague, and Beijing began to appear. As I read many of the new books and articles based on these newly released archival materials, and as I began examining the documents themselves, I was struck with a surprising and repeated fact, often submerged beneath the more dramatic details about espionage, subversion, nuclear blackmail, and proxy wars: leaders in Moscow and Washington often realized that their competition was counterproductive. They often understood the liabilities of the Cold War dynamic. They knew that the global rivalry diverted resources from domestic priorities, and that the arms race made little sense. They realized that the Cold War involved them in civil wars and regional conflicts in Asia and Africa that bore little relation to the vital interests of their own nations. They recognized that local crises in faraway places might engage them in escalatory measures that could get out of control and lead to a nuclear exchange.<br>On the one hand, these new documents suggested that the Cold War leaders were wiser or at least more knowledgeable than I had imagined. They understood the risks they were taking and calculated the tradeoffs they were making. Although this was interesting, it was also troubling. Why did they continue a rivalry that courted disaster for all humankind? Why did they continue a rivalry that diverted resources from priorities their own people clearly favored? Why were they not content to demonstrate the superiority of their way of life without arms races and proxy wars? If they grasped, even occasionally, that they had much to gain from avoiding a cold war, or modulating it, or disengaging from it, why did they not do so? And why did things change in the mid-1980s?<br>Many explanations have been given for the behavior of the two superpowers during the Cold War. These explanations often focus on great men, some of whom were outrageously evil, such as Joseph Stalin, some of whom spoke nobly about freedom and diversity, such as John F. Kennedy, and all of whom are fascinating to us&#x2014;for the power they wielded and for their potential to do good or bad in the world.<br>Other explanations focus on the configuration of power in the international system. All governments respond to dynamics in the international environment that are beyond their control, the argument goes. They seek to fill power vacuums or, alternatively, strive to survive in a dangerous world where threats abound and where the na�ve are punished if they are lucky and perish if they are not.<br>But governments do not simply respond to changes in the international environment. Governments are run by men and women with ideas and historical memories. Their beliefs and memories influence their understanding of what is going on in the world, shape their perception of threat and opportunity, and inspire dreams and visions about what might be accomplished at home and abroad.<br>Yet these men and women cannot always do what they aspire to do, because they are buffeted by domestic interest groups, public opinion, and powerful bureaucracies. Democratic statesmen are sensitive to domestic constituencies and to legislative-executive relationships, and they are sometimes beholden to economic interest groups whose views they may not share. Leaders in authoritarian, even totalitarian, countries must also contend with bureaucracies that have divergent aims and concerns. No leader, anywhere, acts in a domestic vacuum in which policy can be made with indifference to internal constituents, bureaucracies, and interest groups.<br>Leaders also have their constituents abroad, formal allies and sometimes informal clients, governments with their own interests that they pursue vigorously, sometimes with cunning and guile and sometimes with a dazzling candor and boldness. These clients and allies are never as weak as they may seem, and great powers aiming for hegemony cannot disregard them.<br>In seeking to understand why the Cold War lasted as long as it did, I have pondered the role of human agency. I have looked at the so-called realist theories that focus on power and survival and that dwell on the distribution of power in the international system. I have examined the influence of ideas, ideologies, and historical memories and pondered how officials construct their own realities. I have weighed the impact of domestic opinion, interest groups, and bureaucracies, including the military-industrial complexes. I have tried to analyze the role of allies and clients. My desire was to follow the trail of the evidence, keeping in mind the many persuasive interpretations of great-power behavior during the Cold War. Yes, of course, this is a na�ve statement. Its intent is to suggest that I was not consciously wed to a particular theory, and that I had an open mind about the interpretative power of different lines of inquiry. I wanted to think about all of them and weigh them against the evidence.<br>The documentation intrigued me. The records newly opened in Moscow and other communist countries after 1989, which most scholars never imagined seeing during the Cold War, are fascinating. Of course, they are incomplete, but they are suggestive. Access to Russian materials has waxed and waned over the last fifteen years. I have relied heavily on documents translated by the Cold War International History Project, the National Security Archive, and the Miller Center of the University of Virginia. For American records, I have spent lots of time at the presidential libraries and the National Archives. Normally, U.S. national security documents less than twenty-five years old would not be available in any significant numbers, but many of the most important ones can now be seen in the collections of the Cold War International History Project and the National Security Archive. These organizations and their institutional affiliates in the United States and around the globe have held &#x201c;oral history&#x201d; conferences with leading Cold War decision makers. For these meetings, they secured the declassification of treasure troves of documents, which I have employed systematically. In the latter parts of this book, I use these records to examine the erosion of d�tente in the 1970s and the end of the Cold War in the 1980s. There are fascinating transcripts of the meetings of Leonid Brezhnev with presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter and even more illuminating transcripts of the discussions between Gorbachev and Reagan. If I can convey a sense of the richness of these materials, I will have accomplished a good deal.<br>This book is not, however, a narrative history of the Cold War. Rather, it is an examination of five &#x201c;moments&#x201d; during it, that is, short intervals of time when officials in Moscow and Washington thought about avoiding or modulating the extreme tension and hostility between the United States and the Soviet Union. By exploring their motives and analyzing why they made the choices they did, I hope to illuminate the underlying dynamics of the Cold War overall.<br>The &#x201c;moments&#x201d; I have chosen for illustrative purposes are fascinating episodes in the Cold Wa...</p><h2>Henry Ford: Young Man With Ideas (Childhood of Famous Americans)</h2><p>One of the most popular series ever published for young Americans, these classics of childhood have been praised alike by parents, teachers, and librarians.

In his many years of teaching throughout the world, the Korean-born Zen Master Seung Sahn has become known for his ability to cut to the heart of Buddhist teaching in a way that is strikingly clear, yet free of esoteric and academic language. In this book, based largely on his talks, he presents the basic teachings of Buddhism and Zen in a way that is wonderfully accessible for beginners&#x2014;yet so rich with stories, insights, and personal experiences that long-time meditation students will also find it a source of inspiration and a resource for study.</p><p>Zen Master Seung Sahn (1927&#x2013;2004) was the first teacher to bring Korean Zen Buddhism to America, having already established temples in Japan and Hong Kong. In 1972 he came to the United States and started what became the Providence Zen Center, the first center in what is now the Kwan Um School of Zen, which now includes more than eighty centers and groups worldwide. His students called him Dae Soen Sa Nim, "Great Honored Zen Teacher," and he was the 78th Zen master in his line of dharma transmission in the Chogye order of Korean Buddhism. His books include <i>The Compass of Zen</i>, <i>Dropping Ashes on the Buddha</i>, <i>Only Don't Know, </i> and <i>The Whole World Is a Single Flower: 365 Kong-ans for Everyday Life</i>.Buddhism The Purposes of Buddhism <p>First attain enlightenment, then instruct all beings. </p><p>Many centuries ago, the Greek philosopher Socrates used to walk through the streets and marketplaces of Athens, teaching his students. He would say to them, "You must understand yourself! You must understand yourself! You must understand yourself." Then one day a student said, "Sir, you always say we must understand ourselves. But do you understand your self?" </p><p>"No, I don't know myself," Socrates replied. "But I understand this 'don't know.'" This is very interesting teaching. Buddhist practice points at the same experience, because most human beings pass through their lives without the slightest sense of what they are. </p><p>We understand many things about this world, but we don't understand ourselves. So why do human beings come into this world? Why do we live in this world? For love? For money? For respect or fame? Do you live for your wife, husband, or children? Why do you live in this world? If someone asked you these questions, you might very well answer, "I live for my children. I live to earn enough money for them, or maybe just to have a good life." Most people think like this. They live only for their family, for some fleeting social respectability, perhaps to enjoy art or to get some powerful position. Everyone wants to have a good situation for themselves. If you look at this world very closely, it is easy to see that most people eat and sleep and live merely for their own personal happiness. Yet these things are not the real purpose of human beings' life. They are just temporary means for living in the world. If human beings cannot find out who they are, how can they ever be truly happy? The Buddha came from a royal family in India some twenty-five hundred years ago. He was a prince, named Siddhartha Gautama. He had a very good situation. In the palace he had everything he wanted: good food, good clothes, many beautiful women, a high seat, and a very good position. He was the son of the king, and someday he would inherit a powerful kingdom. That's very wonderful! But inside, Siddhartha was very unhappy, because he could not understand who he was. He could not understand life or death. He was deeply saddened that all beings must eventually get sick, grow old, and die. This gave him a big question about his own nature and the nature of all beings. "What am I? I don't know. . . ." At that time in India, the Brahmin religion of Hinduism was followed by nearly everyone. But Brahmanism could not give the young prince the correct answer to his burning question. So he was even more unhappy. "Why do human beings come into this world? Why do we eat every day? What am I?" He ate food, but there was no taste. Heard music, but it gave him no pleasure. The beautiful palace became like a prison. </p><p>One night, Siddhartha left the palace. He left his family, his beautiful wife, and his infant child, cut off all his hair, and became a monk. Then he went to the mountains. For six years he practiced very, very hard. "What am I? Don't know . . ." He courageously kept this question with one-pointed determination. Then one morning, while sitting in meditation under the Bodhi tree, he saw the morning star in the eastern sky. At that moment--BOOM!--Siddhartha and this star completely became one. He realized his true substance. He realized that his mind was the universe--infinite in time and space--and the whole universe was nothing other than his own mind. He realized there is no life and no death. Nothing ever comes or goes. We say that he woke up and attained his true nature. He completely attained human consciousness: he saw that when ignorance appears, mind appears. When mind appears, desire appears. When any kind of desire appears, life and death, coming and going, happiness and sadness all appear. By completely keeping a don't-know mind one hundred percent--only go straight, don't know--the Buddha saw how to completely stop this endless cycle. He attained complete liberation from the eternal round of birth and death in which all beings trap themselves. He completely attained his correct way, he attained truth, and he attained the correct kind of life he should lead. The name for that is enlightenment. But this truth that the Buddha attained was a very high-class realization. How could he make it function to help this suffering world? When he got enlightenment, the Buddha perceived all sentient beings being born, suffering, and dying; being born again, suffering, and dying; being born, again suffering, and again dying in an endless round of torment. He saw billions upon billions of beings caught in the beginningless cycle of birth, old age, sickness, and death, wandering around and around and around and around, nonstop, only following their desire, anger, and ignorance. The name for this is samsara. "I want this. I want that. I like this. I don't like that." When he attained enlightenment, the Buddha perceived every sentient being in a terrible state of suffering. It was a condition to which they had become so accustomed that it seemed normal. How would anyone ever believe what he had seen? "How can I teach this to other people?" he thought. It was like a man with a very high-class Ph.D. trying to teach little children what he'd learned: how would they ever understand? Sentient beings were so controlled by their desire minds, and so attached to their suffering way, he wondered if anyone would ever connect with this teaching. Sutras say that for several moments the Buddha doubted whether he should attempt to teach this. Perhaps people would have laughed at him, or worse, killed him for his heretical insight. The Buddha saw all this too. He could have stayed in this nirvana, his enlightenment, a state of infinite stillness and bliss, and never come out. </p><p>But the Buddha had profound compassion for sentient beings. He got up from his seat under the Bodhi tree, he left the stillness and bliss of nirvana, and he went into the contentious cities and towns to teach human beings. He left his "good situation." He did not attach to stillness and quiet. He did not attach to his bliss. He did not stay in nirvana, a state where there is no suffering or life or death. The Buddha returned to the noisy, fractious world to save all beings from suffering by showing them that it was possible to completely attain their own original nature, just as he had done. His enlightenment experience was not for him alone. That is a very important point. The characters for that are dae ja, dae bi: Great Love and Great Compassion. The Buddha attained enlightenment, which means that he attained his great function and the function of all beings. This was the beginning of Buddhism in this world.</p></p><h2>Technical Drawing with Engineering Graphics</h2><p><p>This full-color text offers a clear, complete introduction and detailed reference for creating 3D models and 2D documentation drawings.

Despite dire warnings and escalating concern over the state of our planet, many people feel out of touch with the natural world. Nobel laureate Wangari Maathai has spent decades working with the Green Belt Movement to help women in rural Kenya plant&#x2014;and sustain&#x2014;millions of trees. With their hands in the dirt, these women often find themselves empowered and &#x201c;at home&#x201d; in a way they never did before. Maathai wants to impart that feeling to everyone, and believes that the key lies in traditional spiritual values: love for the environment, self-betterment, gratitude and respect, and a commitment to service. While educated in the Christian tradition, Maathai draws inspiration from many faiths, celebrating the Jewish mandate <i>tikkun olam</i> (&#x201c;repair the world&#x201d;) and renewing the Japanese term <i>mottainai</i> (&#x201c;don&#x2019;t waste&#x201d;). Through rededication to these values, she believes, we might finally bring about healing for ourselves and the earth.</p><p>WANGARI MAATHAI is the founder of the Green Belt Movement, which has planted over 45 million trees across Kenya since 1977. In 2002, she was elected to Kenya&#x2019;s Parliament, and in 2003, she was appointed Deputy Minister for the Environment and Natural Resources, posts she held until 2007. Maathai was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004. In 2009, she was appointed a United Nations Messenger of Peace by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>Beginnings<br><br>Within a few years of its inception in 1977, the Green Belt Movement (GBM) expanded from a small, tree-planting project at the National Council of Women of Kenya to a full-time engagement. Simultaneously, a small number of community groups grew to a network of thousands of such groups. As this occurred, it became clear that both the groups and the individuals were not upholding standards of behavior that they expected of others, especially those in government, which was already much criticized. These standards included honesty, hard work, and a commitment to transparency and accountability. It gradually became clear that the Green Belt Movement's work with communities to repair the degraded environment could not be done effectively without participants embracing a set of core spiritual values.<br><br>Therefore, it became necessary to raise awareness of issues of governance and the management of resources. Consequently, these values- love for the environment, gratitude and respect for the earth's resources, self-empowerment and self-betterment, and the spirit of service and volunteerism-emerged as a central feature of what we came to call "civic and environmental education." These comprised a set of seminars that we held for those wanting to participate in the work of the movement so they could know the procedures and values that should guide them. The seminars were designed to deepen individuals' understanding of the root causes of ecological destruction and the role political management of resources can play in the breakdown of the environment. Participants were encouraged to delve into why their environment was degraded, and the role that they and other members of their communities and society at large play in this.<br><br>At each seminar, each group enumerates its problems. It is then challenged to explore where those problems came from and how to develop a set of actions it can take to solve them both immediately and in the long term-at individual, household, and community levels, and on a small or larger scale. While many people may see a reason to plant trees to meet their own basic needs, the idea of creating a clean and healthy environment that may benefit everyone rather than only individuals is new. During the seminars, women and men who have been passive about environmental issues around them, become self- empowered and energized to take action. They embrace the idea of being willing to work for something larger than themselves. When they return to their homes, they become eager to report how many tree seedlings they have nurtured in tree nurseries, how many trees they've planted, and how many people they've talked to in their local assemblies, including churches, about their newfound interest. For many GBM members, their satisfaction in their own efforts means that even the small financial compensation they receive for each tree seedling that survives becomes the token it is intended to be, rather than a formal payment for the work done. Their circle of concern expands beyond themselves and encompasses the common good.<br><br>Those who embrace the values at the heart of the seminars-love for the environment, gratitude and respect for the earth's resources, self- empowerment and self-betterment, the spirit of service and volunteerism-remain involved in tending tree nurseries, transplanting seedlings, and restoring landscapes and indigenous forests. They also engage in other GBM activities such as collecting rainwater, terracing their fields to stem soil erosion, and planting food crops in their gardens to improve food security for their households. They also are involved in building and maintaining low-tech sand dams to ensure water supplies in the dry season. And, moreover, they stand up and advocate for their rights to a clean and healthy environment.<br><br>In the beginning of the work with the Green Belt Movement, it surprised me that many individuals and groups did not practice these spiritual values as part of their faith. By then, almost everybody was a Christian and these values are deeply entrenched in Christian teachings. I'd had them transmitted to me first by parents, then by teachers, friends, members of my community, and associates. My mother was always working hard, and I helped her in ways that now I can hardly believe. Even though I was very young, I cultivated food crops in the field, gathered firewood, fetched water from a nearby stream, went to the market, and ran many errands for her. I took care of my young siblings, and on one memorable occasion carried home a huge harvest of red kidney beans that was too heavy even for our family's donkey. My father, too, worked hard as a mechanic on a British settler's farm and supported a large family.<br><br>As I was growing up, I also learned that my grandparents' generation had maintained a proud heritage that had a strong commitment to justice, sense of right and wrong, and a belief in honesty. They didn't have to learn these values; they were simply passed along as an inheritance, very early in life. When children are exposed to values, and they see them embraced by those around them in their actions, the values become part of their personalities and hard to unlearn.<br><br>At school, I was encouraged to be honest, too, and I was lucky to possess a mental attitude that was not constrained by judgment or religious dogmas. Catholic nuns-first the Consolata sisters from Italy, then the Irish Loreto nuns, and finally the Benedictine sisters of Mount St. Scholastica College in the United States-taught me from the age of twelve. They encouraged my curiosity, an embrace of the scientific method, and the use of critical thinking. Such exposure made it easy for me to listen and assess without prejudgments, and this has assisted me greatly in my life journey.<br><br>Today, people often ask me how I determined all those decades ago that the environment was so important. To a certain extent it was not my discovery. I was led by events that were happening around me at the time. For example, in 1972, the United Nations held its first global conference on the environment in Stockholm, Sweden. In 1973, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) was established in Nairobi, with Maurice Strong as its first executive director. I was invited to join a group that established the Environmental Liaison Center International, a nongovernmental (nonprofit) environmental organization founded to work closely with UNEP and monitor its activities.<br><br>As I gained knowledge from others who knew much more than I did then, I became interested. This enabled me to respond when, in the lead-up to the first UN women's conference in Mexico City in 1975, I listened to rural women in Kenya listing their problems. I could see that all the challenges they had were rooted in a degraded rural environment. Planting trees came to me as a concrete, doable response.<br><br>I came to identify trees as the answer to the environmental problems the Kenyan women faced, partly because I grew up in the countryside surrounded by trees and green vegetation. But I was also fortunate at the time to be involved with organizations that were becoming aware of this issue. I can also point to the Source as the wellspring for all of the ideas that came.<br><br>Sometimes the inspiration to act arrives as a spark; sometimes it takes the form of a process. Whether one is drawn into an action through a sudden rush of inspiration, or through the slow dawning of a realization that something needs to change, I would argue that it all comes from the Source. But it's nonetheless essential to cultivate an attitude that allows you to take advantage of that awakening. This entails keeping your mind, eyes, and ears open, so that when an idea arrives you'll be ready for it. To be able to capitalize on our inspiration it is also important to be predisposed to welcome new sets of knowledge and retain an open mind. We need to appreciate as much as possible that a further horizon always lies beyond the one we see in front of us; there are always opportunities to learn and to examine one's own perception in light of recent information or revelations.<br><br>Ideas, it would seem, are like fruits hanging from trees: when they're ripe, you have to be ready to catch them before they fall. Like the five wise virgins of Jesus' parable (see Matt. 25:1-13), we must seize the opportunities presented to us, by making sure that we're fully prepared with the appropriate mental, physical, and spiritual capacity to take on the challenge. The environment must be ripe.<br><br>Sometimes such an awakening comes in the process of work or engagement in a cause or a joint effort. You realize how important something is- as I did with the environment-and you begin moving from working by yourself to communicating its importance to others. Before long, almost before you realize it, you have many people working with you.<br><br>When I told the rural women about the benefits of trees-that they'd help stem soil erosion and improve the health of the soil, making it possible to grow healthy foods; that they'd provide firewood, fodder for livestock, and shade; that they'd help regulate rainfall and provide a habitat for small animals and birds-I discovered that I'd opened a Pandora's box. In trying to solve one environmental problem, I found there were many other problems that the women and their communities needed to solve.<br><br>When I began the civic and environmental seminars, I didn't imagine that the core values at the center of the Green Belt Movement's work would be in such short supply! Without the value of volunteerism, the organization's work would not be sustainable, because we have never been flush with funds. It's impossible to compensate people for every bit of work they do; a price tag cannot and should not be placed on everything we do for the environment. And that is the way it was traditionally, before the cash economy arrived in Kenya: individuals had a profound sense that they must give back to their communities by providing voluntary service for the common good. The farther people moved away from traditional life and became "modern," the less willing they were to serve. Everything had to be paid for, and those who couldn't pay were pushed out.<br><br>This modern deficit in values existed in every aspect of society: within the government, from which we received not only indifference but often outright hostility; among the public, who couldn't believe that anybody, including members of the Green Belt Movement, would be working so hard solely for the common good. Each assumed that we must have an ulterior motive, such as money, or power, or political advantage-not least because there seemed to be no good reason why we would not be practicing the vices that brought money, power, or political advantage and patronage. No one seemed to realize that such vices-which included selfishness, greed, and the exploitation of the available resources-would cause harm that would eventually affect everyone. This deep disconnection from others and the environment would come back to haunt the same society.<br><br>When the women came to the GBM and complained that they didn't have enough firewood to cook healthy food for their children, naysayers couldn't argue that trees were not a practical response. What they wondered was why I made it my business to work with them and find a solution. When I explained how important it was not to deforest Kenya's main water catchment areas and not to plant the wrong type of tree along the riverbanks, in forests, or in wetlands, it was self- evident that a severe problem-water and soil erosion-was being addressed. What detractors questioned was why I should be concerned about it.<br><br>"Don't you have anything better to do with your education?" some people asked. After all, as I was part of a small, educated elite within Kenyan society, someone who'd been a professor at the University of Nairobi, it was expected that I should be in the classroom dealing with academic matters rather than in the fields persuading rural women to plant trees. But I wasn't alone digging holes! Many other women were planting trees with me and were also expending considerable effort for something more than material compensation and personal gain. They, too, must have been motivated by a set of values and not just responding to their basic needs and individual gratification.<br><br>Since its beginning, the Green Belt Movement has moved from the simple act of tree-planting to meet immediate needs to attempting to mitigate the effects of climate change and heal the earth's wounds. When it started undertaking advocacy on matters of governance and rights, challenging those in power who were destroying the environment and putting citizens in danger in the process, some people may have thought it was silly, or foolhardy. Sometimes I wasn't sure myself why I continued. I knew, though, that the work wasn't being done for any ulterior motive, and that the GBM was addressing serious issues. I became even more certain that what we were doing was right, because we were dealing with basic and viable solutions to real and chronic problems. Experiences fed on themselves, and propelled participants and the work to the next level. Serving for the common good might be taxing or even dangerous at times, but the Source and the values are strong forces that kept us moving forward.<br><br>In time, individuals from outside of Kenya (principally Europe and the United States) reached out and wanted to support the GBM's work financially. They did this not because they wanted participants to gain personally, but because they wanted to do something good for the environment and the people living in the region. They recognized that we needed to protect our environment, but poverty was widespread. When I found myself in trouble with the Kenyan government, a number of people put their lives on the line to help me. Why did they bother, even though they were not next of kin, members of the same ethnic group, or my countrymen? It was because, like many others in the world, they were not driven by selfishness, the need to control others, or the desire to accumulate more. They were motivated by compassion, empathy, and recognition that the environment needs to be protected everywhere and that this is a matter of global concern to all.<br><br>Through this combination of questions about motivations, the development of the civic and environmental seminars, and my work in the field with Green Belt Movement groups, I've been encouraged to search more deeply into the issue of spiritual values.

His story of exile and return was their story as well. In the well-known tale of the prodigal son, Jesus reshaped the story in his own way and for his own purposes. In this work, Kenneth E. Bailey compares the Old Testament saga and the New Testament parable. He unpacks similarities freighted with theological significance and differences that often reveal Jesus&#39; particular purposes. Drawing on a lifetime of study in both Middle Eastern culture and the Gospels, Bailey offers here a fresh view of how Jesus interpreted Israel&#39;s past, his present and their future.</p><p>Kenneth E. Bailey (1930&#x2013;2016) was an acclaimed author and lecturer in Middle Eastern New Testament studies. An ordained Presbyterian minister, he served as Canon Theologian of the Anglican Diocese of Pittsburgh. The author of more than 150 articles in English and in Arabic, his writings include <em>Jesus Through Middle Eastern Eyes</em>, <em>The Good Shepherd</em>, <em>Open Hearts in Bethlehem: A Christmas Drama</em>, and <em>The Cross and the Prodigal</em>. Bailey spent forty years living and teaching in seminaries and institutes in Egypt, Lebanon, Jerusalem and Cyprus. For twenty of those years he was professor of New Testament and head of the Biblical Department of the Near East School of Theology in Beirut where he also founded and directed the Institute for Middle Eastern New Testament Studies. Bailey was also on the faculty of The Ecumenical Institute for Theological Research in Jerusalem. Traveling around the globe to lecture and teach, Bailey spoke in theological colleges and seminaries in England (Oxford, Cambridge, Bristol) Ireland, Canada, Egypt, Finland, Latvia, Denmark, New Zealand, Australia, and Jerusalem. He was active as a Bible teacher for conferences and continuing education events in the Middle East, Europe, and North America, and he taught at Columbia, Princeton, and Fuller Seminary."Ken Bailey's <em>Jacob and the Prodigal,</em> a monumental work, will set the stage for all subsequent New Testament scholars working on the 'so-called' parable of the Prodigal Son." (Review of Biblical Literature)<br><br><em>"Jacob and the Prodigal</em> is excellently written, very readable, filled with a spirit of reverence for the great subject it talks about and replete with the scholarly nuggets of the Near-Eastern expert that nobody else can provide at this time. The novelty of the New Testament as well as its continuity with the old covenant is wonderfully worked out while offering us a captivating reading of the <em>Evangelium in Evangelio.</em> A book with many refreshing discoveries." (Ulrich W. Mauser, Professor Emeritus, Princeton Theological Seminary)<br><br>" 'There cannot be anything new left to be said about the parable of the prodigal son.' Really? Not when Kenneth Bailey sets to work with his phenomenal knowledge of Scripture and Jewish writings, the Middle-Eastern scene and early Arabic commentators on the New Testament! The result is a highly readable, exciting and stimulating new reading of the stories in Luke 15 in tandem with the story of Jacob. Preachers on these stories will never be able to expound them again in the way that they used to do but will find treasures new in them thanks to this insightful treatment. The gospel stands out all the more clearly as a result of Bailey's interpretation." (I. Howard Marshall, Honorary Research Professor of the New Testament, University of Aberdeen)<br><br>"Kenneth Bailey's <em>Jacob and the Prodigal</em> offers a fascinating study in biblical intertextuality that opens up new and exciting possibilities in the interpretation of one of Jesus' best-known parables, that of the prodigal son. The importance of Bailey's exegesis is not limited to this one parable but has significance for our understanding of the whole of Jesus' theology." (Craig A. Evans, Payzant Professor of New Testament, Acadia Divinity College, Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada)<br><br>"Bailey's knowledge of the scholarly literature is matched by his intimate understanding of ancient texts and cultures, and these together bring interpretative insights unavailable from any other writer. Here Bailey outlines how Jesus taught in his culture and day. He then focuses his energies on a brilliant and persuasive treatment of Luke 15 and shows how the 'Jacob Saga' of Genesis informed the dramatic framework of Jesus' most famous parable. Bailey is one of the 'great teachers' and through this volume we can listen to the wealth of his life of research." (Gary M. Burge, Ph.D., Professor of New Testament, Wheaton College and Graduate School)<br><br>"Kenneth Bailey has become the premier commentator in our generation on the cultural world behind Jesus' parables. And of all the parables, Bailey keeps returning to the prodigal son more than any other one. Here, in one very insight-filled yet readable layperson's book, is a more accessible form of much of his previous commentary on Luke 15, plus more--fascinating parallels with Genesis and the accounts of Jacob and Esau. Bailey is undoubtedly right that there is more of the full-orbed gospel of redemption in this parable than first meets the eye." (Craig L. Blomberg, Distinguished Professor of New Testament, Denver Seminary, Denver, Colorado)</p><h2>Undoing Border Imperialism (Anarchist Interventions, 6)</h2><p>Harsha Walia has played a central role in building some of North America&#x2019;s most innovative, diverse, and effective new movements. That this brilliant organizer and theorist has found time to share her wisdom in this book is a tremendous gift to us all.&#x201d; Naomi Klein, author of <i>The Shock Doctrine</i><br><br>Undoing Border Imperialism combines academic discourse, lived experiences of displacement, and movement-based practices into an exciting new book. By reformulating immigrant rights movements within a transnational analysis of capitalism, labor exploitation, settler colonialism, state building, and racialized empire, it provides the alternative conceptual frameworks of border imperialism and decolonization. Drawing on the author&#x2019;s experiences in No One Is Illegal, this work offers relevant insights for all social movement organizers on effective strategies to overcome the barriers and borders within movements in order to cultivate fierce, loving, and sustainable communities of resistance striving toward liberation. The author grounds the book in collective vision, with short contributions from over twenty organizers and writers from across North America.<br><br><b>Harsha Walia</b> is a South Asian activist, writer, and popular educator rooted in emancipatory movements and communities for over a decade.<br><br>Praise for <i>Undoing Border Imperialism</i>:<br><br> Border imperialism is an apt conceptualization for capturing the politics of massive displacement due to capitalist neoglobalization. Within the wealthy countries, Canada&#x2019;s No One Is Illegal is one of the most effective organizations of migrants and allies. Walia is an outstanding organizer who has done a lot of thinking and can write not a common combination. Besides being brilliantly conceived and presented, this book is the first extended work on immigration that refuses to make First Nations sovereignty invisible.&#x201d; Roxanne Dunbar Ortiz, author of <i>Indians of the Americas and Blood on the Border</i><br><br> Harsha Walia&#x2019;s <i>Undoing Border Imperialism</i> demonstrates that geography has certainly not ended, and nor has the urge for people to stretch out our arms across borders to create our communities. One of the most rewarding things about this book is its capaciousness astute insights that emerge out of careful organizing linked to the voices of a generation of strugglers, trying to find their own analysis to build their own movements to make this world our own. This is both a manual and a memoir, a guide to the world and a guide to the organizer's heart.&#x201d; Vijay Prashad, author of <i>The Darker Nations: A People&#x2019;s History of the Third World</i><br><br> This book belongs in every wannabe revolutionary&#x2019;s war backpack. I addictively jumped all over its contents: a radical mixtape of ancestral wisdoms to present-day grounded organizers theorizing about their own experiences. A must for me is Walia&#x2019;s decision to infuse this volume&#x2019;s fight against border imperialism, white supremacy, and empire with the vulnerability of her own personal narrative. This book is a breath of fresh air and offers an urgently needed movement-based praxis. <i>Undoing Border Imperialism</i> is too hot to be sitting on bookshelves; it will help make the revolution.&#x201d; Ashanti Alston, Black Panther elder and former political prisoner<p><b>In Oakland, California on March 24, 2015 a fire destroyed the AK Press warehouse along with several other businesses.

Through a careful survey of primary sources and disclosure of formerly secret records, Evans and Romerstein have written a riveting historical account that traces the vast deceptions that kept Stalin's henchmen on the federal payroll and sabotaged U.S. policy overseas. The facts presented here expose shocking cover-ups, from the top FDR aides who threatened internal security and free-world interests by exerting pro-Red influence on U.S.policy, to the grand juries that were rigged, to the countless officials of the Roosevelt and Truman administrations who turned a blind eye to the penetration problem. Stalin's Secret Agents convincingly indicts in historical retrospect the people responsible for these corruptions of justice.</p><p><b>M.

Evans and Romerstein are conservative journalists, and both have written extensively on issues related to the Cold War. Here they deal with the issue of &#x201c;massive&#x201d; and, in their view, effective Soviet infiltration of agents into the highest levels of the successive Roosevelt administrations during the 1930s and 1940s. And they aren&#x2019;t making stuff up. Using recently declassified information from both Soviet and American archives, they show that Soviet efforts at subversion were indeed massive, but that point has been made before. Yet Evans and Romerstein go much further. They assert that successful Soviet efforts to insert agents into the government led, naturally, to the passing of information and also to strong influence over foreign policy. For example, based on very fragmentary evidence, they claim that Alger Hiss strongly influenced the American concessions made at Yalta. This work will be red meat for many conservative ideologues but is unlikely to persuade more objective readers. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>Saintly Solutions to Life&#39;s Common Problems: From Anger, Boredom, and Temptation to Gluttony, Gossip, and Greed</h2><p><p>Whatever you're struggling with, you're not alone: there's a saint who is not only praying for you before the throne of God, but who went through the same thing you're going through.

Nine-forty! What if Erin had already left the coffee shop by the time we got there? <em>What if she's not there?</em> That sentence kept running through my head as I got Bella up and moving. She'd had a dream about her stuffed lamb and wanted to tell me the whole thing, but all I could think about while I changed her into the cleanest clothes I had for her was, <em>What if she's not there?</em><br><br>On the phone yesterday, Roy had told me I was making the smart choice.

I just had to trust her not to.<br><br>My hands shook as I scratched a note on the back of a gas receipt and stuck it in Bella's pants pocket, sneaking it in there so Bella wouldn't ask me about it or try to pull it out. I remembered the tremor in my mother's hands. "A fine tremor," the doctor had called it and he'd said it was harmless and barely noticeable. Mine wasn't so fine. I could hardly help Bella get her socks straight on her feet.<br><br>"I'm hungry, Daddy," she said as she pulled on her shoes.<br><br>I opened some Tic Tacs and shook a couple into her hand. "We'll get breakfast in a minute," I said, as she popped the Tic Tacs into her mouth.<br><br>I pictured Erin finding the note. She <em>would</em> find it, wouldn't she? If she didn't, then what? I thought of all the things that could go wrong and my head hurt like a bitch.<br><br><em>First things first,</em> I told myself. First I had to get to JumpStart before Erin left or else the whole plan was going to cave in. "I got to go potty," Bella said.<br><br>"Yeah, baby, me too." I ran a comb through her dark hair, which I really should have tried to wash in the Target rest-room last night like I did once already this week. Last night, though, washing her hair had been the furthest thing from my mind. She needed a haircut, too, but it wasn't like I'd thought of bringing scissors with me when we left Carolina Beach. Her bangs were almost long enough to put behind her ears now, and I tried that, but as soon as she hopped out of the van, her hair fell into her face again. Poor kid. She looked like an orphan nobody cared about. I prayed to God she didn't become one tonight.<br><br>I held her hand as we walked toward the coffee shop.<br><br>"You're hurting my hand, Daddy," she said, and I realized I was holding on to her way too tight. How could I do this to my baby girl? I couldn't even prepare her for what was going to happen. <em>Bella, I'm sorry.</em> I hoped she was so young that she'd never remember this. Never think of it as the day her daddy abandoned her.<br><br>Wildflowers filled the grassy strip of land next to the coffee shop and I had a sudden idea. They were nothing but weeds, but they'd do. "Look, Bella." I pointed toward them. "Let's pick some of these for Miss Erin." We stepped onto the lawn and began picking the flowers and I hoped Bella's bladder could hold out one more minute. The flowers were the only way I could think of to thank Erin for what I was going to ask her to do.<br><br>She was sitting in the brown leather chair where she always sat, reading something on her iPad, as usual, and brushing a strand of light brown hair out of her eyes. I felt a crazy rush of relief and a crazy rush of disappointment. If she hadn't been there, I would have no way to do what I was going to do tonight, and that would have been a good thing. But she <em>was</em> there and she smiled like she'd been waiting for us.<br><br>"There she is!" Bella shouted loudly enough for the two girls at the corner table to look over at us. They were close to my age. Twenty-two. Twenty-three. One of them smiled at me, then went red in the face and looked away. I hardly glanced at her. I only saw the thirtysomething woman sitting in the leather chair. I felt like hugging her.<br><br>"Hey," I said, like it was any other morning. "How's it going?"<br><br>"Good." She reached out to run a hand down Bella's arm. "Good morning, honey," she said. "How are you today?"<br><br>"We had Tic Tacs for breakfast," Bella said.<br><br>"Well, we'll get something a little better here," I said, embarrassed.<br><br>"Did you?" Erin asked. "Were they yummy?"<br><br>Bella nodded, her bangs falling over her eyes.<br><br>"We need to use the bathroom, don't we, Bell?" I said, then I looked at Erin. "You'll be here a minute?"<br><br>"Oh, I'm not going anywhere," she said.<br><br>"These are for you." I held the flowers toward her and wished I'd thought to tie them together with something, but with what? "Bella picked them for you this morning."<br><br>"How pretty!" She took the flowers from my hand, sniffed them and then put them on the table. "Thank you, Bella."<br><br>I spotted a kids' book on the table next to the flowers. "Looks like Miss Erin has a new book to read you," I said, hoping that was true. A book would keep Bella busy while I... I couldn't think about it.<br><br>"I got to go potty, Daddy," Bella reminded me.<br><br>"Right." I reached for her hand. "We'll be back in a sec," I said to Erin.<br><br>In the restroom, I rushed through the teeth-brushing, the going potty and the face-washing. My hands were like a guy with DTs and I mostly let Bella brush her own teeth. It was all I could do to brush mine. I didn't bother to shave.<br><br>Erin had moved the book to the arm of the chair by the time we got back.<br><br>"I think you're going to love this one, Bella," she said. She held her arms out to my four-year-old daughter, who climbed into her lap like she'd known Erin all her life. <em>Thank you, God,</em> I thought. What I was going to do tonight was as wrong as wrong could be, but the fact that Erin had been put in my path this week made me think maybe it was supposed to happen.<br><br>"I'm going to grab my coffee and our muffin," I said. "Can I get you anything, Erin?" I asked, like I could actually afford to buy her something.<br><br>"I'm fine," she said. "I picked up an OJ for Bella."<br><br>I knew&#x2014;and had known from day one&#x2014;that it was Bella she was into and not me. That was fine. Perfect, actually. "Okay," I said. "Thanks."<br><br>I ordered my coffee and a muffin and a cup of water for Bella. When I went to pick up the water from the counter, I knocked the damn thing over with my not-so-fine tremor. "Sorry!" I grabbed a handful of napkins from the holder on the counter and started to mop up.<br><br>"No problem," said Nando, the barista who waited on me every morning. He called to a girl in the back who came out and cleaned up my mess while he got me another cup of water. He put the cup and the coffee and muffin in one of those cardboard carriers, and I lifted it carefully and took it back to my seat.<br><br>Erin and Bella were deep in their story. Bella asked her questions, pointing to things in the book. She rested her head against Erin's shoulder, looking kind of sleepy. That dream had gone on and on last night, she'd said, and we woke up so late. She looked as totaled as I felt. I'd use some of the money I'd make tonight to find a clinic and get her checked out. She wasn't exactly eating a great diet these days, either. I was about to break the muffin in half to split with her, but decided to give her the whole thing instead. I didn't think I could eat this morning, anyway.<br><br>I sat down on the couch, wondering how to time things. I couldn't wait too long. I had no idea when Erin would leave the coffee shop. I sipped my coffee and it felt like acid going down. <em>You suck as a father,</em> I thought to myself.<br><br>Erin came to the end of a chapter and said they'd take a little break while Bella ate her muffin.<br><br>"Come over here to eat so you don't get it all over Miss Erin," I said to Bella.<br><br>"Oh, she's fine here," Erin said. "Just set the water on the table."<br><br>I did, although I wanted Bella back right then. Yeah, I was glad she was so happy on Erin's lap and all that, but I wanted to hold her right now. I'd scare her, though&#x2014;holding her too tight the way I'd squashed her hand when we walked across the parking lot. It was better this way. Now, how to make my graceful exit. I hadn't quite thought through that part. Maybe I'd say I needed to use the restroom again, but they'd be able to see me if I left the restroom and went out the door.<br><br>"So, just a couple more days till you go back to work?" I asked Erin. I needed to make sure she didn't need to go back to the pharmacy any sooner than that. I hoped I'd figured this out right.<br><br>"Don't remind me." She rubbed Bella's back. Bella had blueberry stuck in her teeth and I was glad I'd remembered to put her toothbrush in her little pink purse.<br><br>"Do you ever feel, you know, <em>tempted</em> being around all those drugs all the time?" I asked. Why the hell did I ask her that? I had no idea. Nerves. I was a frickin' mass of nerves.<br><br>She gave me a look like I was a total lowlife. "Not even a little bit," she said. "And please don't tell me you <em>would</em> be tempted."<br><br>I tried to smile. "No way," I said, "It's not my thing." Why'd I even go there? I worried she could see how I was shaking today and think I was using something. Suddenly, I knew how to handle the next few minutes. "I've got another interview today," I said.<br><br>"Great! You found something on Craigslist?"<br><br>"No, my friend came through." I tapped my sweaty fingers on my thighs. "I hope this one works out."<br><br>"Oh, me too, Travis. I guess it's in construction? Is it for a business? Or residential? Or&#x2014;"<br><br>"I've got the info in my van," I said, getting to my feet. "Can you watch Bella a sec and I'll go get it? I can tell you the address and maybe you can tell me how to get there."<br><br>"Sure," she said. I couldn't move all of a sudden. I wanted to take Bella back into the restroom and hug her so hard, but I had to get this over with. Just do it. I bent over and kissed Bella's head, then walked away fast. Out the door, across the parking lot, into my van. Fast, fast, fast, before I could change my mind. I turned the key in the ignition. I couldn't leave the van here where Erin and Bella would be able to see it when they came out of JumpStart. I drove all the way to the other end of the lot, nearly crashing into parked cars, my foot jerking all over the gas pedal, the whole wide world a blur in front of me and one word on my mind. <em>Bella Bella Bella.</em><br><br></p><h2>The Fear of the Feminine</h2><p><p>These essays by the famous analytical psychologist and student of creativity Erich Neumann belong in the context of the depth psychology of culture and reveal a prescient concern about the one-sidedness of patriarchal Western civilization. Neumann recommended a "cultural therapy" that he thought would redress a "fundamental ignorance" about feminine and masculine psychology, and he looked for societal healing to a "matriarchal consciousness" that forms the bridge between the feminine and the creative.</p><br><p> Brought together here for the first time, the essays in the book discuss the psychological stages of woman's development, the moon and matriarchal consciousness, Mozart's <i>Magic Flute,</i> the meaning of the earth archetype for modern times, and the fear of the feminine. In Mozart's fantastic world, Neumann saw a true <i>Auseinandersetzung</i>--the conflict and coming-to-terms with each other of the matriarchal and the patriarchal worlds. Developing such a synthesis of the feminine and the masculine in the psychic reality of the individual and of the collective was, he argued, one of the fundamental, future-oriented tasks of both the society and the individual.</p></p><p><b>Erich Neumann</b> was born in Berlin in 1905. A student of C. G. Jung, he practiced analytical psychology in Tel Aviv from 1934 until his death in 1960.

Clearly written overviews of specific symptoms are coupled with space for you to write in your own thoughts on treatment, prognosis, and your ultimate goals. Checklists and daily planners help to identify both areas of difficulty and positive experiences; later in the book, you'll find charts for tracking medications, diet, and doctor visits. </p><p> A full section is devoted to the establishment and maintenance of a support group. Ideas range from open discussions with family members to seeking out volunteer work, and it's this section that may be the trickiest for the depressed to work through.

In recent decades, however, these lost works have reemerged, and the eerie poetry and poignant humanity of Platonov&#x2019;s vision have become ever more clear. For Nadezhda Mandelstam and Joseph Brodsky, Platonov was the writer who most profoundly registered the spiritual shock of revolution. For a new generation of innovative post-Soviet Russian writers he figures <br>as a daring explorer of word and world, the master of what has been called &#x201c;alternative realism.&#x201d; Depicting a devastated world that is both terrifying and sublime, Platonov is, without doubt, a universal writer who is as solitary and haunting as Kafka.<br><br>This volume gathers eight works that show Platonov at his tenderest, warmest, and subtlest. Among them are &#x201c;The Return,&#x201d; about an officer&#x2019;s difficult homecoming at the end of World War II, described by Penelope Fitzgerald as one of &#x201c;three great works of Russian literature of the millennium&#x201d;; &#x201c;The River Potudan,&#x201d; a moving account of a troubled marriage; and the title novella, the extraordinary tale of a young man unexpectedly transformed by his return to his Asian birthplace, where he finds his people deprived not only of food and dwelling, but of memory and speech.<br><br>This prizewinning English translation is the first to be based on the newly available uncensored texts of Platonov&#x2019;s short fiction.</p><p><b>ANDREY PLATONOV</b> (1899&#x2014;1951), the son of a metalworker and the eldest of ten children, was born in a village near the Russian town of Voronezh. He began to publish poems and stories in the 1920s and worked as a land reclamation expert in central Russia, where he was a witness to the ravages of the Great Famine. In the 1930s Platonov fell into disfavor with the Soviet government and his writing disappeared from sight. <br><br>JOHN BERGER is the author of numerous works of fiction and nonfiction, including <i>To the Wedding</i>, the <i>Into their Labours</i> trilogy, <i>About Looking, Ways of Seeing, and G</i>., for which he won the Booker Prize.

This is the final in a three-volume series that covers the entire book of Revelation in awe-inspiring detail, expounding and expanding on familiar verses in God's Word that have been misunderstood and misconstrued for many years. Or, in some cases, linking together verses and concepts that have been repeatedly overlooked. In this volume the authors explore the second half of Revelation from the perspective they established so clearly in Volumes 1 and 2 - that of a Hebrew God speaking through a Hebrew believer to an audience that was intimately familiar with the Hebrew language, culture, customs, and concepts that form both the literal and the metaphorical foundation for vast portions of Revelation. In the process they answer a multitude of important questions, including the following: Whose Bride are you? Can you change sides or are you stuck forever in a relationship you really don't want? What is the ancient framework by which you can identify most of the players? Who or what is the False Messiah? Who or what is the False Prophet? What is the Second Death? Who will experience it? How does it differ from any other death? These are just some of the questions to which you'll find plausible, sensible, biblically sound answers in this volume. Please join us, right now, for another voyage of discovery unlike anything you've embarked on before, even if you've already read the first two volumes! About the Authors: Collectively, John Klein and Adam Spears have studied the Scriptures for more than sixty years. Together they have also taught countless hours of biblical courses, on Hebrew foundations, that bring alive the Holy Scriptures. Their motto, "If you don't know covenant you can't know Scripture!" identifies one of the primary concepts that these two long-term scholars believe underlies the entire Bible, from the first verse in Genesis to the last verse of Revelation. Both authors spend their time studying, writing, teaching, and counseling on full-time schedules. In addition, John is associate leader for House of Covenant, a Messianic congregation in Bend, Oregon, while Adam serves as the congregational leader. Michael Christopher is a writer/editor and a long-term veteran of the publishing industry. He has worked with dozens of authors, both famous and unknown, to produce religious and secular books of many different kinds. But he has never enjoyed any book project as much as this three-volume series, nor has he ever learned as much in the process.</p></p><p></p><h2>Plantation Slave Weavers Remember: An Oral History</h2><p>The narratives of former slaves and the children of slaves in Plantation Slave Weavers Remember is an oral history of the weaving, spinning, dyeing and knitting activities of African-Americans during enslavement.

Forty years ago, corporate agribusiness told small farmers like the Oiens to &#x201c;get big or get out.&#x201d; But twenty-seven-year-old David Oien decided to take a stand, becoming the first in his conservative Montana county to plant a radically different crop: organic lentils. Unlike the chemically dependent grains American farmers had been told to grow, lentils make their own fertilizer and tolerate variable climate conditions, so their farmers aren&#x2019;t beholden to industrial methods. Today, Oien leads an underground network of organic farmers who work with heirloom seeds and biologically diverse farm systems. Under the brand Timeless Natural Food, their unique business-<i>cum</i>-movement has grown into a million dollar enterprise that sells to Whole Foods, hundreds of independent natural foods stores, and a host of renowned restaurants.<br><br> From the heart of Big Sky Country comes this inspiring story of a handful of colorful pioneers who have successfully bucked the chemically-based food chain and the entrenched power of agribusiness&#x2019;s one percent, by stubbornly banding together. Journalist and native Montanan Liz Carlisle weaves an eye-opening and richly reported narrative that will be welcomed by everyone concerned with the future of American agriculture and natural food in an increasingly uncertain world.</p><p><b>Liz Carlisle</b> holds a BA from Harvard University and a PhD in geography from the University of California at Berkeley. Carlisle is also a country music singer-songwriter who has opened shows for Travis Tritt, LeAnn Rimes, and Sugarland. She currently lives in Berkeley, California.<p></p><p></p><p>AUTHOR&#x2019;S NOTE</p><p>In March of 2008, I filled up my Subaru at the cheapest gas station in Somerville, Massachusetts. Three dollars and twenty-two cents was more than I&#x2019;d ever paid for a gallon of regular unleaded, even at the height of summer. But I&#x2019;d scouted the marquees around town, and this was as low as I was going to get. The pump clicked off, and I stuffed the receipt into an envelope in the glove compartment without looking at the total. I knew I couldn&#x2019;t afford it. And gas prices didn&#x2019;t appear to be going down.</p><p>Four years into my career as a country singer, I was tired. Exhausted. At first, it had been thrilling to open for LeAnn Rimes and Travis Tritt, to record at Martina McBride&#x2019;s studio in Nashville, and to sing the national anthem at an NFL game. Born and raised in Montana, I&#x2019;d grown up on country radio, and I loved weaving romantic agrarian lyrics into pretty melodies. When I&#x2019;d graduated from college, with a new record to sell and a full schedule of shows for the summer, it had seemed like the greatest thing in the world to travel through rural America and tell its story. But now that I&#x2019;d crisscrossed the country several times in my station wagon, I knew the sobering truth. I&#x2019;d been lying.</p><p>As I listened to the people who came up to chat after my shows, it dawned on me that life in the heartland was not what I&#x2019;d thought. Farming had become a grueling industrial occupation, squeezed between the corporations that sold farmers their chemicals and the corporations that bought their grain. To my disappointment, I discovered that most American farmers weren&#x2019;t actually growing food but rather raw ingredients for big food processors. These multinational corporations dictated everything their growers did, from the seeds they planted to the expensive fertilizers and herbicides they needed to grow them. It was a losing game for the farmers, who kept sinking further into debt as their input costs rose and grain prices fell. But the arrangement was great for the corporations, which kept right on dealing chemicals to their captive suppliers of cheap corn, soy, and wheat. Flush with marketing dollars, Big Food was working hard to convince middle America that their folksy branded products were the protectors of the family farm and its wholesome values. I thought about the companies that sponsored my shows and felt a creeping wave of guilt. I&#x2019;d bought into their phony story hook, line, and sinker&#x2014;and I was propagating it.</p><p>The song I always sang to open my concerts talked about corn popping up in neat rows next to a peaceful river. But in fact, the fertilizer running off America&#x2019;s cornfields had so thoroughly choked the Mississippi watershed with nitrogen that farm towns were subsisting on bottled water, and the Gulf of Mexico was sporting a dead zone the size of Massachusetts. It wasn&#x2019;t as if the flood of fertilizer were helping farmers. All those fossil fuel&#x2013;based chemicals were sending rural households into bankruptcy, just like gas prices were crushing me. As I drove away from the pump in Somerville, I realized it was time for me to tell the real story of farming, food, and rural America. Maybe I could even help to change it. So in the spring of 2008, I quit the music business. And I joined the lentil underground.</p><p>Strictly speaking, I didn&#x2019;t exactly know I was joining the lentil underground when I went to work for US senator Jon Tester in June of 2008. What I knew was that Jon was an organic farmer from a small town in my home state of Montana. He seemed to have some good ideas for fixing the problems with American agriculture, so that farmers could make a good living growing healthy food. And in the process, he was changing the face of national politics. By unseating a three-term Republican incumbent, Jon had handed senate Democrats a razor-thin majority&#x2014;and a flat-topped populist poster child.</p><p>From my first week on the job as Tester&#x2019;s legislative correspondent for agriculture and natural resources, I started getting calls from his equally colorful fellow farmers. They surprised me with deeply considered, homegrown policy proposals, recalling an era of our democracy so distant that I&#x2019;d long since dismissed it as mythological. Was I on the phone with Franklin? Jefferson? I might as well have been, given how seriously these farmers took their civic duty to tinker, diagram, and reason their way to a better polity. Although I was dubious that I could do anything to shepherd these farmers&#x2019; unorthodox proposals to the floor of the Senate, I had to admit that my enthusiastic correspondents had some pretty good ideas. Of course, most establishment types thought Jon&#x2019;s buddies were crazy. Strange crops. Messy-looking fields. &#x201c;Weed farmers,&#x201d; one prominent constituent told me. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re a bunch of damn weed farmers.&#x201d;</p><p>But if these were weed farmers, I gathered, they were remarkably solvent ones. Unlike the other growers who called into the office, these organic farmers weren&#x2019;t complaining about grain prices, because they didn&#x2019;t sell to big corporations, and they were raising a lot more than just grain. They weren&#x2019;t complaining about the cost of chemicals either, because they didn&#x2019;t use them. They&#x2019;d found a crop that could grow its own fertilizer: lentils.</p><p>I got so curious about these farmers and their miraculous lentils that I started calling <i>them,</i> peppering them with questions about all the crops in their rotations. But as quickly as I&#x2019;d gotten excited, I found myself frustrated again. I thought I&#x2019;d happened onto a simple, technical solution to the crisis in farm country. But instead, my farmer informants kept regaling me with meandering stories that dragged long into my lunch break before I finally cut them off with a polite &#x201c;Thanks for sharing your thoughts.&#x201d; I was about to give up when one of the farmers leveled with me. &#x201c;I know you folks out in DC are always looking for a quick fix, and I just want you to know that this isn&#x2019;t it,&#x201d; the farmer said. &#x201c;But if you&#x2019;d like to come out and visit, you&#x2019;re always welcome.&#x201d; I hung up the phone, grouchy. I was at work late again, vainly attempting to stay on top of the flood of e-mails about wolves, guns, and abortion. I knew the office wasn&#x2019;t about to send me on a junket to Montana to check out a field of lentils. I was mad at myself for my foolish idealism, mad at myself for wasting time on a dead end.</p><p>But as I lay in bed that night, I started thinking more seriously about the farmer&#x2019;s invitation. As he&#x2019;d warned, this wouldn&#x2019;t be a quick fix. It would take a long time to really understand what these organic growers were up to. I would need to quit my job and focus on this project full-time, probably for several years. I had a lot to learn about ecology, economics, and the real history of the agrarian West&#x2014;not just the version I&#x2019;d absorbed from country radio. And yet, maybe it was worth it.</p><p>The next evening, I started researching graduate schools, looking for a place where I could get the training I needed and then conduct in-depth field research. It wasn&#x2019;t easy to find a doctoral program with the breadth I was looking for, since most departments focused their students on a highly specialized area of study. But the PhD at UC Berkeley&#x2019;s Geography Department seemed like a good fit. In June of 2009, after thirteen months in DC, I said good-bye to Jon Tester, promising that our next visit would be at his Montana farm. And in August, I moved to Northern California to register for my first semester of classes.</p><p>By the summer of 2011, I&#x2019;d made it far enough into my formal studies to venture out to Montana to meet some farmers. I picked up my parents&#x2019; station wagon in Missoula, then headed off for a part of the state I&#x2019;d never been to before&#x2014;the dry plains just east of the Rocky Mountains. There, in a sleepy little town named Conrad, I found the man I was looking for: Dave Oien.</p><p>Dave wasn&#x2019;t the first farmer I&#x2019;d spoken to when I started working in the Tester office. In fact, I&#x2019;m not sure I ever talked directly to him at all. But when I asked people to tell me who had convinced them to go organic, the answer always circled back to this little Conrad farm. On these 280 acres&#x2014;his parents&#x2019; homestead&#x2014;Dave had done something truly radical. During the height of the 1980s farm crisis, he&#x2019;d become the first in his county to plant organic lentils. Back then, Dave had been laughed off as a kook. But now he had more than a dozen other people growing for his small business, Timeless Seeds, which had gotten specialty lentils on the shelves at Whole Foods and on the menus of the nation&#x2019;s finest restaurants.</p><p>When I pulled in to the Oien place, I was greeted by an unassuming man in a faded plaid work shirt and jeans. He&#x2019;d tucked his spectacled eyes under a too-big ball cap, which shaded his face from the sun but also gave the impression that his head was smaller than it was. Slumping a bit as he traversed his garden, the balding farmer curled his six-foot frame toward the landscape, refusing to stand out. He answered my questions politely and factually, as if he were a repairman explaining how he&#x2019;d fixed my faucet. While Dave played the common yeoman, I settled into my own performance, inspecting his soil as though that was all I was interested in. As I had explained to Dave on the phone, I was here to conduct research for my dissertation about diversified farming systems on the northern Great Plains.</p><p>Dave and I talked through each other for several minutes, as I dutifully wrote down his list of crops and the soil amendments he was using. I didn&#x2019;t tell him that I&#x2019;d been doing my homework on him and his lentils, and that this was more than just a short-term research project. I didn&#x2019;t mention any of the uncanny parallels in our stories. The fact that I was twenty-seven, the same age he&#x2019;d been when he came back to this farm. The fact that I&#x2019;d come here on the same road from Missoula that he&#x2019;d traversed thirty-five years before. The fact that I, too, had been trying to save the world in faraway places before realizing that I needed to start at home. I didn&#x2019;t remind him that I was from Montana myself and that my &#x201c;research vehicle&#x201d; was my parents&#x2019; car.</p><p>But of course, my journey had been far longer than the four-hour drive from my parents&#x2019; house. I&#x2019;d spent my entire adulthood combing through poetry, policy, and scholarship in search of an agrarian answer to the vexing problems of modern society. I&#x2019;d consulted authorities of all stripes, from salt-of-the-earth sages in Nashville, to political gurus in Washington, to scientists and food activists in Berkeley. How could we feed the world without destroying it? After several years of searching, I knew there were important answers to this question that I couldn&#x2019;t find in a high-tech lab or a high-powered policy summit, or even in popular local food movements in San Francisco and New York. But those answers might be here in Conrad, if only I could get Dave to talk.</p><p>And then he smiled. Without moving his mouth, Dave vaulted his eyebrows into his forehead and opened his eyes so wide they nearly filled the yawning lenses of his glasses. He&#x2019;d noticed the number four on the far left of my license plate, which every Montanan knows as the code for Missoula. &#x201c;Did you know Joseph Brown?&#x201d; he asked me.</p><p>Joseph Epes Brown was a legendary figure in my hometown, a professor of religious studies who&#x2019;d passed away in 2000 after an illustrious but somewhat enigmatic career at the University of Montana. At age twenty-seven, he had traveled the West in an old truck, seeking Lakota elder Black Elk. When Brown finally found the elderly medicine man, in Nebraska, Black Elk was nearly blind, but he greeted his young visitor knowingly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been expecting you,&#x201d; Black Elk told Brown, who would later publish an account of their conversations at the Lakota man&#x2019;s request.</p><p>Although I hadn&#x2019;t mentioned it to Dave, I&#x2019;d read that account. And I knew he had too. One day in the Tester office, curious about this farmer that everyone kept mentioning to me, I&#x2019;d started digging around for information about Dave and discovered that he had once been a student of Joseph Brown&#x2019;s at the University of Montana. In fact, if I had the dates right, it appeared Dave would&#x2019;ve taken Brown&#x2019;s class right before returning to this homestead.

Surveying the withered crop across the farm belt, analysts warned that climate change might seriously threaten the American food supply. Local forecasters watched in grim silence as the red zone of federally declared disaster areas swelled to cover 71 percent of the national map. Already squeezed by recession, households across the United States braced for skyrocketing food prices.</p><p>Meanwhile, outside a small Montana town on the Missouri River, two dozen vehicles converged on a 3,000-acre farm. Compact hybrids sporting lefty bumper stickers pulled up next to old pickups with gun racks, and PhD engineers enthusiastically greeted college dropouts. From as far north as the Canadian border and as far east as the Dakotas they rolled in, nonchalantly hauling coolers and potluck dishes as if this were just the neighborhood block party.</p><p>The occasion was the annual field tour for Timeless Seeds, an organization that, on the surface, appeared to be a modest small business. But what Timeless and its growers were doing out here on the northern plains was nothing short of revolutionary. They&#x2019;d spent the past three decades quietly but systematically bucking big agriculture, sowing the seeds of a radically different food system. Now they were about to find out whether their experiment was working.</p><p>A bit nervous about hosting a field tour just four years into his organic transition, greenhorn Timeless grower Casey Bailey wasn&#x2019;t feeling particularly lucky on this Friday the thirteenth of July. The relentlessly hot weather had thoroughly baked the Baileys, who were scrambling to adjust their harvest calendars and praying their crops would come through. Casey was worried about the looming threat of hail, given the eerie humidity in the air. And as he approached his field of French Green lentils, with more than thirty guests in tow, Casey was embarrassed to discover that the one plant that appeared to love this heat was his &#x201c;volunteer&#x201d; stand of sunflowers. Nowhere to be seen on Casey&#x2019;s farm plan, the big yellow flowers had simply blown in from the surrounding area and seeded themselves. Now they were everywhere.</p><p>&#x201c;This is my only field that&#x2019;s bad with weeds,&#x201d; Casey told the crowd staring down at him from a hay-covered wagon. Why did his weed problem have to be such a flamboyant one? Casey brooded. And why hadn&#x2019;t he come out here before the tour and thinned some of this out? Casey&#x2019;s fellow growers tried to put a more positive spin on the increasingly heterogeneous Bailey farm. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s biodiverse,&#x201d; Doug Crabtree offered in a booming baritone, as his wife nodded. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to stop apologizing,&#x201d; Anna Jones-Crabtree chimed in forcefully, extemporaneously suggesting a mantra: &#x201c;Mo...</p></p><h2>Wives and Daughters (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>A story of romance, scandal and intrigue within the confines of a watchful, gossiping English village during the early nineteenth century</b><br><br>When seventeen-year-old Molly Gibson's widowed father remarries, her life is turned upside down by the arrival of her vain, manipulative stepfather. She also acquires an intriguing new stepsister, Cynthia, glamorous, sophisticated and irresistible to every man she meets. The two girls begin to confide in one another and Molly soon finds herself a go-between in Cynthia's love affairs - but in doing so risks losing both her own reputation and the man she secretly loves. Set in English society before the 1832 Reform Bill, Elizabeth Gaskell's last novel - considered to be her finest - demonstrates an intelligent and compassionate understanding of human relationships, and offers a witty, ironic critique of mid-Victorian society. <br><br> This text is based on the 1866 Cornhill Magazine version of the novel. It also includes notes on textual variants between this edition and the original manuscript, a note on the story's ending and an introduction discussing the novel's challenging investigation of themes of Englishness, Darwinism and masculine authority. <br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>Set in English society before the 1832 Reform Bill, Wives and Daughters centres on the story of youthful Molly Gibson, brought up from childhood by her father. When he remarries, a new step-sister enters Molly&#39;s quiet life - loveable, but worldly and troubling, Cynthia. The narrative traces the development of the two girls into womanhood within the gossiping and watchful society of Hollingford. Wives and Daughters is far more than a nostalgic evocation of village life; it offers an ironic critique of mid-Victorian society. &#39;No nineteenth-century novel contains a more devastating rejection than this of the Victorian male assumption of moral authority&#39;, writes Pam Morris in her introduction to this new edition, in which she explores the novel&#39;s main themes - the role of women, Darwinism and the concept of Englishness - and its literary and social context.<b>Elizabeth Gaskell </b>was born in London in 1810 but spent most of her life in Cheshire, Stratford-upon-Avon.

Throughout their two decades of dominance, Art Nouveau artists concentrated on the ornamental and decorative potential of the flowing line in painting, printing, wallpaper, and all other fine and applied arts. Hundreds of thousands of carefully wrought designs embellished books, bookplates, furniture, and appliances. A fashionable home was a garden of graphic florals, petals, leaves, and stems.<br>Today, Art Nouveau is again attracting artists, designers, and craftsmen of all kinds, while these countless ornamental flourishes have perished with their ephemeral surroundings. Art Nouveau motif seekers have been left with little choice but to resort to expensive archives of rare books. Here, taken directly from those rare books and periodicals, are 577 royalty-free authentic period designs specially chosen for artists and designers. The ornaments range in size from full-page illustrations to borders, head and tailpieces and decorative initials. All are in black-and-white line, clearly reproduced.<br>Many of the creations come from the influential English periodical <i>The Studio</i> (1894&#x2013;1920) and the French <i>Art el D�coration</i> (1897&#x2013;1910); others from a variety of original European sources, all identified. Artists represented include Gustav Klimt, George Auriol, Ethel Larcombe, and Will Bradley, along with hundreds of English. French, Italian, German, Scandinavian, and American studio draftsmen, all identified when possible. The designs are grouped by subject matter: florals, landscapes, figures, etc. There are spot illustrations, bookplates, menus, title pages, and many, many swirling line forms.</p></p><p></p><h2>Last Rituals: A Novel of Suspense (Thora Gudmundsdottir Novels, 1)</h2><p><p> At a university in Reykjav�k, the body of a young German student is discovered, his eyes cut out and strange symbols carved into his chest. Police waste no time in making an arrest, but the victim's family isn't convinced that the right man is in custody. They ask Th�ra Gudmundsd�ttir, an attorney and single mother of two, to investigate. It isn't long before Th�ra and her associate, Matthew Reich, uncover the deceased student's obsession with Iceland's grisly history of torture, execution, and witch hunts. But there are very contemporary horrors hidden in the long, cold shadow of dark traditions. And for two suddenly endangered investigators, nothing is quite what it seems . . . and no one can be trusted. </p></p><p><p>Yrsa Sigurdard�ttir is an award-winning author of five children's novels and a division manager with one of Iceland's largest engineering firms. She lives with her family in Reykjav�k, Iceland.</p>Similar in plot to Swedish author Helene Tursten's The Glass Devil, this first in a new series from Icelandic author Sigurdardottir offers little readers have not seen before. As with Tursten's novel, the spectre of demon-worship is at the heart of the mystery, after the strangled corpse of Harald Guntlieb is discovered with his eyes gouged out. Guntlieb, a German student, was attending graduate school in Iceland, examining the latter country's history of witch-hunting, an academic pursuit that may have taken on more personal overtones. His grieving parents, who had already suffered the loss of a child, enlist attorney and single mother Th�ra Gudmundsd�ttir to objectively assess the police case against a drug addict arrested for the murder. Aided by an attractive ex-German police officer, Gudmundsd�ttir diligently tracks down the dead man's friends and colleagues, before arriving at the truth. The author gives less of a sense of her native land than other contemporary Scandinavian crime writers like Karin Fossum, and the identity of the killer will surprise few. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Full facsimile of the original edition. Not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. This classic account of the Psychopathic Personality was first published in 1941. We reprint herein the expanded Second Edition of 1950. Cleckley describes clinical interviews with patients in a locked institution. The text is considered to be a seminal work and the most influential clinical description of psychopathology in the twentieth century. The basic elements of psychopathology outlined by Cleckley are still relevant today. The title refers to the normal &#34;mask&#34; that conceals the mental disorder of the psychopathic person according to Cleckley&#39;s conceptualization. Cleckley describes the psychopathic person as outwardly a perfect mimic of a normally functioning person, able to mask or disguise the fundamental lack of internal personality structure, an internal chaos that results in repeatedly purposeful destructive behavior, often more self-destructive than destructive to others. Despite the seemingly sincere, intelligent, even charming external presentation, internally the psychopathic person does not have the ability to experience genuine emotions. Cleckley questions whether this mask of sanity is voluntarily assumed to intentionally hide the lack of internal structure, but concludes it hides a serious, but yet imprecisely unidentified, semantic neuropsychiatric defect.</p><p></p><h2>The Money Answer Book: Quick Answers To Your Everyday Financial Questions</h2><p><p>This quick and simple, question and answer book is the perfect resource for equipping individuals with key information about everyday money matters.

As all seeing is a form of cognition, higher seeing is the key to higher cognition or knowing. <br><br> For human beings the spiritual world is hidden deep within the disguise of the world available to the senses and deep within the human psyche, and human consciousness, enmeshed as it usually is in the physical senses, cannot easily be aware of both worlds. The human soul is the link between the physical sense-imbued body and direct experience of the spirit, because it has the latent ability to focus consciousness into any number of levels. The ability to determine the focus of awareness is our great gift and our great challenge. <br><br> In this practical and accessible guidebook, Dennis Klocek, building on the alchemical tradition and the Western path of initiation developed by Rudolf Steiner, shows how the soul&#x2019;s latent ability can be awakened by conscious acts of will and rhythmical practices. The practices begin wherever we are in our everyday lives and take the seeker through the levels of concentration&#x2015;the ability to create and hold an inner image; contemplation&#x2015;the ability to transform the image and make it dynamic; and meditation&#x2015;the ability to reverse the image, or think it backward into inner silence. <br><br> After presenting the practical exercises, along with commentary, that identify and lay out the steps, Klocek shows us how the path can be followed through to an understanding of a seemingly impenetrable alchemical image of the soul&#x2019;s journey as he guides us up the Alchemical Mountain to heartfelt thinking. Through such a journey, it becomes possible for human beings to live as spiritual beings among other spiritual beings. <br><br> For those who are serious about developing faculties of higher knowing and seeing, <i><b>The Seer&#x2019;s Handbook</b></i> is a unique, practical, and friendly handbook of exercises, meditations, and insightful commentary that will guide both beginners and more advanced students along the path to higher worlds.</p><p>Dennis Klocek, MFA, has been an art teacher and is director of the Consciousness Studies Program at Rudolf Steiner College.

These sharks were the alphas among alphas, some longer than twenty feet, and there were too many to count; even more incredible, this congregation was taking place just twenty-seven miles off the coast of San Francisco. In a matter of months, Casey was being hoisted out of the early-winter swells on a crane, up a cliff face to the barren surface of Southeast Farallon Island - dubbed by sailors in the 1850s the &#34;devil&#39;s teeth.&#34; There she joined Scot Anderson and Peter Pyle, the two biologists who bunk down during shark season each fall in the Island&#39;s ori:e habitable building, a haunted, 135-year-old house spackled with lichen and gull guano. Two days later, she got her first glimpse of the famous, terrifying jaws up close, and she was instantly hooked; her fascination soon yielded to obsession-and an invitation to return for a full season. But as Casey readied herself for the eight-week stint, she had no way of preparing for what she would find among the dangerous, forgotten islands that have banished every campaign for civilization in the past two hundred years. &#34;The Devil&#39;s Teeth&#34; is a vivid dispatch from an otherworldly out-post, a story of crossing the boundary between society and an untamed place where humans are neither wanted nor needed. In a world where very little is known for certain, we knew that below us a great white shark was orbiting, waiting for the seal to bleed some more, and that this shark would soon be returning for breakfast. It might be Betty or Mama or the Gadillac, one of the huge females that patrolled the east side of the island. These big girls, all of them over 18 feet long, were known as the sisterhood. Or it might be a &#34;smaller&#34; male (say, 14 or 15 feet) like Two Spot or T-Nose or the sneaky Gal Ripfin. These sharks were called the rat pack. It might be any number of great whites. At this time of the year there were scores of them cruising this 120-acre patch of sea, swimming close to the shoreline of Southeast Farallon Island as hapless seals washed out of finger gulleys at high tide and into the danger zone. In any given year more than a thousand people will be maimed by toilet bowl cleaning products or killed by cattle. Less than a dozen will be attacked by a great white shark. In this neighbourhood, however, odds do not count. At the Farallon Islands in autumn, your chance of meeting a great white face-to-face is better than even money, should you be crazy enough or unlucky enough to end up in the water.</p><p>&#34;I read Susan Casey&#39;s book in a feeding frenzy, satisfying my curiosity while fueling my fascination with sharks. A thoroughly researched and well-written piece of literature that raises hairs as well as tickling funny bones, THE DEVIL&#39;S TEETH artfully reveals what lurks in the shadows of the mysterious great white and the people obsessed with them. The true triumph of the book, though, is in Casey&#39;s transcendence of mere journalism--she&#39;s clearly embraced by the world of which she writes.&#34; --Linda Greenlaw, Author of THE HUNGRY OCEAN and ALL FISHERMEN ARE LIARS&#34;A marvelous book--part adventure, part meditation, part natural history -- that takes the reader on a wild ride into a strange and seductive world. Casey is the perfect diving companion; her account of life among San Francisco&#39;s shark population is engaging, smart, and irresistible.&#34; --Susan Orlean, author of &#34;My Kind of Place&#34; and &#34;The Orchid Thief&#34; &#34;In delivering us to the Farallon Islands, and then into the souls of the magnificent Great White Sharks that populate its waters, Susan Casey has really delivered us into the DNA of our own beings. The Devil&#39;s Teeth is more than a shark story; it is an account of our instincts, our appetites, even our futures, all beautifully told by a writer compelled to know.&#34;--Robert Kurson, author of &#34;Shadow Divers&#34; &#34;&#39;There&#39;s another world, and it&#39;s in this one, &#39;&#34; declares Susan Casey, reveling in the surreality of her days and nights spent among the world&#39;s coolest, cold-eyed customers, great white sharks. Who knew these beasts lived so close to San Francisco, within the pizza delivery zone of that fair city?

Levi, then a 25-year-old chemist, spent 10 months in the camp. Even Levi's most graphic descriptions of the horrors he witnessed and endured there are marked by a restraint and wit that not only gives readers access to his experience, but confronts them with it in stark ethical and emotional terms: "[A]t dawn the barbed wire was full of children's washing hung out in the wind to dry. Nor did they forget the diapers, the toys, the cushions and the hundred other small things which mothers remember and which children always need. Would you not do the same? If you and your child were going to be killed tomorrow, would you not give him something to eat today?" <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Primo Michele Levi (July 31, 1919 &#x2013; April 11, 1987) was an Italian Jewish chemist and writer.

Assassination strategy, though, is only part of the assignment facing Jack Reacher in <i>Without Fail</i>. This restive, blunt-edged ex-military cop must also determine whether recent threats against VP-to-be Senator Brook Armstrong are legitimate or are primarily intended to embarrass the perfectionist head of Armstrong's new Secret Service detail, M.E. Froelich, who happens to have been a girlfriend of Reacher's late brother.<p> If <i>Without Fail</i> lacks the emotional urgency of Lee Child's previous novel, <i>Echo Burning</i>, it still barely lets the reader catch a decent breath between plot crests.

Unfortunately, a few twists (including the source of a thumbprint applied to the threats against Armstrong) can be figured out in advance, and the story is light on character development. A tiny breach in Reacher's reclusive carapace opens as Froelich transfers the love she once felt for his brother toward him, and there are suggestions that Neagley may have depths of feeling just waiting to be plumbed.

These objects, and the dozens of others featured in this book, elicit nods of recognition and smiles of deep satisfaction, as we recognize the classic outlines, the reassuring elegance, the essential perfection of each one.</p><p> Whether it is the cool, hand-hugging shape of the original Coke bottle, the aerodynamic glory of the Harley-Davidson ElectraGlide Motorcycle, the simple satisfaction of the peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich, or the fluid pleasure of the Mont Blanc fountain pen, the feelings inspired by a truly quintessential object reach far beyond its original use - as need makes way for desire.</p><p> In 65 captivating essays, each one accompanied by a lush photograph, the authors explore the astonishing quality that might be labeled "soul," or simply "rightness" -but is best described by the word that possesses the very quality it defines: Quintessence. Yes, this is a book about the things that make for style and constancy in out lives, but it is more than that. It is a book about the rare quality that turns the goods of our lives into objects sublime, exemplary, and lasting. What does a Slinky toy have in common with a Goodyear Blimp? Quintessence.</p><p> This is a book to savor like the perfect Martini, to luxuriate in like the best-fitting pair of Levis.

The hunger of 800 million happens at the same time as another historical first: that they are outnumbered by the one billion people on this planet who are overweight. Global hunger and obesity are symptoms of the same problem and, what&#x2019;s more, the route to eradicating world hunger is also the way to prevent global epidemics of diabetes and heart disease, and to address a host of environmental and social ills. Overweight and hungry people are linked through the chains of production that bring food from fields to our plate. Guided by the profit motive, the corporations that sell our food shape and constrain how we eat, and how we think about food. The limitations are clearest at the fast food outlet, where the spectrum of choice runs from McMuffin to McNugget. But there are hidden and systemic constraints even when we feel we&#x2019;re beyond the purview of Ronald McDonald.<br><br> Even when we want to buy something healthy, something to keep the doctor away, we&#x2019;re trapped in the very same system that has created our &#x2018;Fast Food Nations&#x2019;. Try, for example, shopping for apples. At supermarkets in North America and Europe, the choice is restricted to half a dozen varieties: Fuji, Braeburn, Granny Smith, Golden Delicious and perhaps a couple of others. Why these? Because they&#x2019;re pretty: we like the polished and unblemished skin.&nbsp;Because their taste is one that&#x2019;s largely unobjectionable to the majority. But also because they can stand transportation over long distances. Their skin won&#x2019;t tear or blemish if they&#x2019;re knocked about in the miles from orchard to aisle. They take well to the waxing technologies and compounds that make this transportation possible and keep the apples pretty on the shelves. They are easy to harvest. They respond well to pesticides and industrial production. These are reasons why we won&#x2019;t find Calville Blanc, Black Oxford, Zabergau Reinette, Kandil Sinap or the ancient and venerable Rambo on the shelves. Our choices are not entirely our own because, even in a supermarket, the menu is crafted not by our choices, nor by the seasons, nor where we find ourselves, nor by the full range of apples available, nor by the full spectrum of available nutrition and tastes, but by the power of food corporations.<br><br> The concerns of food production companies have ramifications far beyond what appears on supermarket shelves. Their concerns are the rot at the core of the modern food system. To show the systemic ability of a few to impact the health of the many demands a global investigation, travelling from the &#x2018;green deserts&#x2019; of Brazil to the architecture of the modern city, and moving through history from the time of the first domesticated plants to the Battle of Seattle. It&#x2019;s an enquiry that uncovers the real reasons for famine in Asia and Africa, why there is a worldwide epidemic of farmer suicides, why we don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s in our food any more, why black people in the United States are more likely to be overweight than white, why there are cowboys in South Central Los Angeles, and how the world&#x2019;s largest social movement is discovering ways, large and small, for us to think about, and live differently with, food.<br><br> The alternative to eating the way we do today promises to solve hunger and diet-related disease, by offering a way of eating and growing food that is environmentally sustainable and socially just. Understanding the ills of the way food is grown and eaten also offers&nbsp;the key to greater freedom, and a way of reclaiming the joy of eating. The task is as urgent as the prize is great.&nbsp;In every country, the contradictions of obesity, hunger, poverty and wealth are becoming more acute. India has, for example, destroyed millions of tons of grains, permitting food to rot in silos, while the quality of food eaten by India&#x2019;s poorest is getting worse for the first time since Independence in 1947. In 1992, in the same towns and villages where malnutrition had begun to grip the poorest families, the Indian government admitted foreign soft drinks manufacturers and food multinationals to its previously protected economy. Within a decade, India has become home to the world&#x2019;s largest concentration of diabetics: people &#x2013; often children &#x2013; whose bodies have fractured under the pressure of eating too much of the wrong kinds of food.&nbsp;India isn&#x2019;t the only home to these contrasts. They&#x2019;re global, and they&#x2019;re present even in the world&#x2019;s richest country. In the United States in 2005, 35.1 million people didn&#x2019;t know where their next meal was coming from. At the same time there is more diet-related disease like diabetes, and more food, in the US than ever before.<br><br> It&#x2019;s easy to become inured to this contradiction; its daily version causes only mild discomfort, walking past the &#x2018;homeless and hungry&#x2019; signs on the way to supermarkets bursting with food. There are moral emollients to balm a troubled conscience: the poor are hungry because they&#x2019;re lazy, or perhaps the wealthy are fat because they eat too richly. This vein of folk wisdom has a long pedigree. Every culture has had, in some form or other, an understanding of our bodies as public ledgers on which is written the catalogue of our private vices. The language of condemnation doesn&#x2019;t, however, help us understand why hunger, abundance and obesity are more compatible on our planet than they&#x2019;ve ever been.&nbsp;Moral condemnation only works if the condemned could have done things differently, if they had choices. Yet the prevalence of hunger and obesity affect populations with far too much&nbsp;regularity, in too many different places, for it to be the result of some personal failing. Part of the reason our judgement is so out of kilter is because the way we read bodies hasn&#x2019;t kept up with the times. Although it may once have been true, the assumption that to be overweight is to be rich no longer holds. Obesity can no longer be explained exclusively as a curse of individual aff luence. There are systemic features that make a difference. Here&#x2019;s an example: many teenagers in Mexico, a developing country with an average income of US$6,000, are bloated as never before, even as the ranks of the Mexican poor swell. Individual wealth doesn&#x2019;t explain why the children of some families are more obese than others: the crucial factor turns out not to be income, but proximity to the US border. The closer a Mexican family lives to its northern neighbours and to their sugar- and fat-rich processed food habits, the more overweight the family&#x2019;s children are likely to be.2 That geography matters so much rather overturns the idea that personal choice is the key to preventing obesity or, by the same token, preventing hunger. And it helps to renew the lament of Porfirio Diaz, one of Mexico&#x2019;s late-nineteenth-century presidents and autocrats: &#x2018;�Pobre Mexico! Tan lejos de Dios; y tan cerca de los Estados Unidos&#x2019; (Poor Mexico: so far from God, so close to the United States).<br><br> A perversity of the way our food comes to us is that it&#x2019;s now possible for people who can&#x2019;t afford enough to eat to be obese. Children growing up malnourished in the favelas of S�o Paulo, for instance, are at greater risk from obesity when they become adults. Their bodies, broken by childhood poverty, metabolize and store food poorly. As a result, they&#x2019;re at greater risk of storing as fat the (poor-quality) food that they can access.3 Across the planet, the poor can&#x2019;t afford to eat well. Again, this is true even in the world&#x2019;s richest country; and in the US, it&#x2019;s children who will pay the price. One research team recently suggested that if consumption patterns stay the way they are, today&#x2019;s US children will live five fewer years,&nbsp;because of the diet-related diseases to which they will be exposed in their lifetimes.<br><br> As consumers, we&#x2019;re encouraged to think that an economic system based on individual choice will save us from the collective ills of hunger and obesity. Yet it is precisely &#x2018;freedom of choice&#x2019; that has incubated these ills. Those of us able to head to the supermarket can boggle at the possibility of choosing from fifty brands of sugared cereals, from half a dozen kinds of milk that all taste like chalk, from shelves of bread so sopped in chemicals that they will never go off, from aisles of products in which the principal ingredient is sugar. British children are, for instance, able to select from twenty-eight branded breakfast cereals the marketing of which is aimed directly at them. The sugar content of twenty-seven of these exceeds the government&#x2019;s recommendations. Nine of these children&#x2019;s cereals are&nbsp;40 per cent sugar. It&#x2019;s hardly surprising, then, that 8.5 per cent of six-year-olds and more than one in ten fifteen-year-olds in the UK are obese. And the levels are increasing. The breakfast cereal story is a sign of a wider systemic feature: there&#x2019;s every incentive for food producing corporations to sell food that has undergone processing which renders it more profitable, if less nutritious. Incidentally, this explains why there are so many more varieties of breakfast cereals on sale than varieties of apples.<br><br> There are natural limits to our choices. There are, for instance, only so many naturally occurring fruits, vegetables and animals that people are prepared to eat. But even here, a little advertising can persuade us to expand the ambit of our choices. Think of the kiwi fruit, once known as the Chinese gooseberry, but rebranded to accommodate Cold War prejudices by the New Zealand food company that marketed it to the world at the end of the 1950s. It&#x2019;s a taste no-one had grown up with, but which now seems as if it has always been there. And while new natural foods are slowly added to our menus, the food industry adds tens of thousands of new products to the she...</p></p><h2>Calculus (9th Edition)</h2><p>Still in good condition.

Summoned to the impeccable village, Barnaby and his bloody-minded sidekick, Sergeant Troy, delve into the strange passions intertwining this eccentric group of amateur writers and discover that the serenity of Midsomer Worthy is merely a facade.</p><p>Dubbed by the Sunday Times as, &#39;Simply the best detective writer since Agatha Christie&#39; and by the Yorkshire Post as &#39;the most underrated British crime writer&#39;, Caroline Graham is the author of eight Inspector Barnaby novels.Many elements in Graham's Chief Inspector Barnaby mysteries harken back to Christie: a small English village setting, a cast of odd characters, a sagacious inspector with his loyal sergeant. In this fourth entry, following Death in Disguise, the Midsomer Worthy Writers' Circle invites author Max Jennings to speak to them. Circle member Gerald Hadleigh is opposed to the choice but refuses to explain. He asks fellow member Rex St. John to stay with him throughout Jennings's visit. But after the event, the elderly St. John is tricked into departing, leaving Hadleigh alone with Jennings. The next morning, Hadleigh is found bludgeoned to death and Jennings is gone. The members of the Writers' Circle respond variously. St. John falls into a deep depression; Laura Hutton, whose love of the victim was unrequited, pitches into a days-long crying and drinking jag; Honoria Lyddiard evinces little reaction; her sister-in-law, Amy, and Sue Clapton are suitably shocked. Sue's husband, Brian, seems almost "gleeful." The skill with which Graham evokes these characters and explores their individual, often damaged, emotional histories rings of Rendell and P.D. James. The few too many coincidences in the plot will be forgiven for the crisp pace and satisfying twist at the end. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Beauty Myth</h2><p><p>The bestselling classic that redefined our view of the relationship between beauty and female identity</p><p></p><p></p><p>In today&#x2019;s world, women have more power, legal recognition, and professional success than ever before.

While emphasizing the problematic and complex nature of this thought he also considers views which stress the unity of Chinese culture.</p><p>Attention is accorded to pre-Confucian texts; the evolution of early Confucianism; Mo-Tzu; the &#x201c;Taoists,&#x201d;; the legalists; the Ying-Yang school; and the &#x201c;five classics&#x201d;; as well as to intellectual issues which cut across the conventional classification of schools. The main focus is on the high cultural texts, but Mr. Schwartz also explores the question of the relationship of these texts to the vast realm of popular culture.</p></p><p>Benjamin I. Schwartz was Leroy B. Williams Professor of History and Political Science, Emeritus, at Harvard University.&#x201c;The book is a lucid, accurate, agreeably written and comprehensive survey, based on a long familiarity with the whole of the literature of Chinese schools of thought down to the second century BC, and its great strength is its range of comparisons with other traditions. Chinese thought has never before been contemplated with quite this breadth of vision... Schwartz&#x2019;s book deserves to stand for some time to come as the most authoritative account of ancient Chinese thought for the Westerner interested in the history of ideas.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>A. C. Graham</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;With this immensely learned book, Mr. Schwartz has challenged those who reflect only on Western historical experience or &#x2018;primitive&#x2019; societies to take the world of thought in ancient China into account... The great contribution of this book is to engage ancient Chinese thought in a dialogue with late 20th-century intellectual, moral and political concerns.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Willard J. Peterson</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[This book] is a fascinating, readable, and even inspiring study of Confucius and the great sages who followed him... A powerful exposition of the great ancient Chinese thinkers... Schwartz&#x2019;s vigilance to the particular fragile core of meaning embedded in the ancient texts makes him an acute commentator... Reading this book will keep the reader from simply appropriating &#x2018;China&#x2019;&#x2015;or the media&#x2019;s image of it&#x2015;into his own scheme of values.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Thomas D&#x2019;Evelyn</b><b>, </b><b><i>Christian Science Monitor</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Schwartz&#x2019;s] arguments are impressive, both in breadth and depth.

Humanity&#39;s spread throughout the globe has begotten what paleontologist Richard Leakey has termed the &#34;sixth age of extinction&#34; -- the most deadly epoch the planet&#39;s fauna have seen since the demise of the dinosaurs. And in the last five hundred years, since the dawn of the age of exploration, this rate of extinction has accelerated ever more rapidly. In A Gap in Nature, scientist and historian Tim Flannery, in collaboration with internationally acclaimed wildlife artist Peter Schouten, catalogs 104 creatures that have vanished from the face of the earth since 1492. From the tiny Carolina parakeet to the majestic Steller&#39;s sea cow, which was over twenty-five feet long and weighed ten tons, all of these animals have become extinct as a direct result of the European expansion into every corner of the globe. Flannery evocatively tells the story of each animal: how it lived and how it succumbed to its terrible destiny. Accompanying each account is a beautiful color representation (life-size in the original painting) by Schouten, who has devoted years of his life to this extraordinary project. Animals from every continent are represented -- American passenger pigeons, Tasmanian wolves, and African blaauwboks -- in this homage to a lost Eden. This extraordinary book is at once a lament for the lost animals of the world and an ark to house them forever in human memory.</p><p>This work offers a tantalizing glimpse into the lives of 103 mammals, reptiles, and birds that have become extinct since 1492. For each animal, Flannery (The Eternal Frontier) describes what is known of its habitat, behavior, and probable cause of extinction. These accounts are beautifully written, often anecdotal, and almost always poignant. Whitney Award-winning wildlife painter Schouten produced the accompanying illustrations, which are stunning, full-color, and sometimes spread across two pages. In some cases, these illustrations may be the most accurate renderings anyone has ever produced of these creatures. Flannery and Schouten did extensive research into the literature and reviewed, in person, skeletal and other remains located in museums; numerous species were excluded owing to insufficient materials upon which to base an accurate drawing. A little more in the way of factual data, such as probable size, would have been appreciated in some of the descriptions. For example, the Kawekaweau, a lizard that once inhabited New Zealand, is described as "giant," but no estimated length or weight is given, even though the authors viewed the skin of one of these geckos. Nevertheless, this book, which includes the "big names" such as the dodo and passenger pigeon as well as many lesser-known but fascinating animals, is highly recommended for all academic and large public libraries. (Map not seen.) Lynn C. Badger, Univ. of Florida Lib., Gainesville <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.There are gaps in every natural area on the planet, created when animal species paid the price for the expansion of our own species--in other words, extinction. The initial spread of humans from our ancestral home in Africa happened so long ago that most of the first victims were never preserved or even depicted. Flannery and artist Schouten show 103 species that have gone extinct between 1500 and 1999, species adequately enough known for Flannery to write about and Schouten to illustrate. Flannery begins this homage to these lost animals with an essay on the age of extinctions, explaining the loss of animals as humans colonized new areas. Presented chronologically, the following portraits and text reveal the extent of our knowledge of each animal. In many cases, little is known except where the animal came from and perhaps a little about what it ate. The true strength of the book, which almost necessitates its purchase, is Schouten's illustrations. This book is as close as we will ever get to these irretrievable animals, and it is highly recommended for all libraries. <i>Nancy Bent</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This is the story of the battle and of what followed, the destruction of a way of life and the persecution of a people. It is the story not of Bonnie Prince Charlie but of ordinary men and women involved in the Rebellion, who were described on the gaol registers and regimental rosters of the time as &#x201c;Common Men.&#x201d; The book recalls them by name and action, presenting the battle as it was for them, describing their life as fugitives in the glens or as prisoners in the gaols, their transportation to the Virginias or their deaths on the gallows.</p><p>John Prebble was born in the UK in 1915 but spent his boyhood in a predominantly Scottish township in Canada.

Established in 1939, this office fused together the Gestapo, the Criminal Police, and the <i>Sicherheitsdienst</i> (Security Service) of the SS. Far from being small cogs in a big bureaucratic machine, Wildt finds that the people who made up the RSHA constructed the concepts and operated the apparatus that carried out the Holocaust.<br> At the center of both theory and practice of persecution and genocide in Nazi-occupied Europe, these young men of the RSHA--none of whom envisioned the systematic annihilation of the European Jews--became radicalized. How this occurred is the central question of Wildt's book. Wildt also discusses the postwar careers of the members of the RSHA. Strikingly, he shows how the leaders of the RSHA evaded the consequences of their actions under the Nazi regime and went on to have important careers in the rebuilt West Germany.<p>An alternate selection of the History Book Club and Military Book Club</p></p><p>Translated by Julia Emerson"This account testifies above all to what humanity itself consists of in its greatness, depravity, and resilience. . . .[Marie B�atrice Umutesi's] story is an epic for our times, a tale to ponder for the lessons it conveys, testimony so powerful and moving that it reaches an unintended literary greatness."&#x2014;Jan Vansina, African Studies Review <p>"Far from the rhetoric of politicians and the abstractions of academics, here is what it means to run for your life, not once, but day after day, month after month.

But in our media-saturated age when many claim to speak for God, how can we evaluate the avalanche of supposedly prophetic speech? What does it mean to truly be prophetic? And when Christians should speak prophetically, how can they do so in a biblical and effective way?

Social health and personal wellbeing keep it at the very center of entertainment, storytelling, and education. In turn, Woods and Patton offer a powerfully consistent argument that leads readers to ask--whether about U2 or Lady Gaga--what's the moral point?

In Discovering Aquinas Aidan Nichols offers a lively and authoritative introduction to the life, thought, and ongoing influence of this singular churchman.<br><br> This book could not have come at a better time. After a lengthy period of declining interest in Aquinas, we are starting to see a Thomistic renaissance, including a renewed appreciation for the way Aquinas's work so brilliantly weaves together philosophy, theology, spirituality, revelation, and ethics. As Nichols writes, "It is because of the wonderfully integrated character of the wisdom of Thomas Aquinas -- integrated not only as supernatural with natural but also as thinking with love -- that the church in our day should not leave him as a fresco on a wall but find inspiration from his teaching and example."<br><br> By means of writing as felicitous as it is insightful, Nichols chronicles the compelling facts of Aquinas's life, explores the major facets of his thought, establishes Aquinas's historical importance, and shows why many today are regarding him as a vital partner in current debates about the future of Christianity.</p><p>Prior of Blackfriars in Cambridge, England, he is aleading Roman Catholic writer and theologian. His otherbooks include Christendom Awake: On Reenergizing theChurch in Culture.&#34;&#34;As an introduction to Aquinas&#39;s thought, this book can be highly recommended.&#34;</p><h2>The Story of Christian Music: from Gregorian Chant to Black Gospel, an Authoritative Illustrated Guide to All the Major Traditions of Music for Worship</h2><p>Music has been at the heart of Christian worship since the beginning, and this lavishly illustrated and wonderfully written volume fully surveys the many centuries of creative Christian musical experimentation.

Her novel Face of Betrayal, which she co-wrote with Lis Wiehl, was a New York Times bestseller. She lives in Oregon with her family.1A Thousand Things Wrong<br>Cheyenne heard the car door open. She didn&#x2019;t move from where she lay curled on the backseat, her head resting on her bent arm. Despite the blanket that covered her, Cheyenne was shivering.<br>She had begged her stepmom to leave the keys in the car so she could turn on the heat if she got cold. After some back-and-forthing, Danielle had agreed. That had only been five minutes ago, and here she was, already back. Maybe the doctor had phoned in the prescription and Danielle hadn&#x2019;t had to wait for it to be filled.<br>Now the door slammed closed, the SUV rocking a little as weight settled into the driver&#x2019;s seat. The engine started. The emergency brake clunked as it was released. The car jerked into reverse.<br>It was a thousand little things that told Cheyenne something was wrong. Even the way the door closed hadn&#x2019;t sounded right. Too fast and too hard for Danielle. The breathing was all wrong too, speeded up and harsh. Cheyenne sniffed. The smell of cigarettes. But Danielle didn&#x2019;t smoke and, as a nurse, couldn&#x2019;t stand anyone who did.<br>There was no way the person driving the car was her stepmom.<br>But why would someone else have gotten in the car? It was a Cadillac Escalade, so it wasn&#x2019;t likely someone had just gotten confused and thought it was their car.<br>Then she remembered the keys. Somebody was stealing the car!<br>And Cheyenne was pretty sure they didn&#x2019;t know she was in it.<br>She froze, wondering how much the blanket covered her. She couldn&#x2019;t feel it on the top of her head.<br>Cheyenne felt like a mouse she had seen in the kitchen one time when she turned on the light before school. Caught in the middle of the floor, it had stood stock-still. Like maybe she wouldn&#x2019;t notice it if it didn&#x2019;t move.<br>But it hadn&#x2019;t worked for the mouse, and now it didn&#x2019;t work for Cheyenne. She must have made some small sound. Or maybe the thief had looked back to see if someone was following and then realized what the shape was underneath the blanket.<br>A swear word. A guy&#x2019;s voice. She had already halfway known that it was a guy, the way she sometimes just knew things now.<br>&#x201c;Who the hell are you?&#x201d; His voice broke in surprise.<br>&#x201c;What are you doing in Danielle&#x2019;s car?&#x201d;<br>Their words collided and tangled. Both of them speaking too fast, almost yelling.<br>Sitting up, she scrambled back against the door, the one farthest from him. &#x201c;Stop our car and get out!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; he shouted back.

None of the animals laughed or even smiled. But everyone has to laugh sometimes, including Farmer Fed. The animals try everything to get him to smile: dancing by the light of the moon in Farmer Fred&#x2019;s clothes, singing chickens, sheep disguised in sunglasses and mustaches. Nothing works and finally the animals decide to leave Serious Farm in search of a more cheerful place to chuckle and graze. Will the animals find a livelier home, and will Farmer Fred ever lighten up?</p><p>Tim Egan is the author and illustrator of several offbeat and humorous tales for children.

Edna climbs onto the fence and crows like a rooster, but Farmer Fred fails to see the humor. When the pigs bark like dogs, he finds it "more weird than funny." The animals dress up in his clothes and dance, but he doesn't even crack a smile. Discouraged, the creatures pack up one night and leave home. After searching high and low, the farmer finds them in the woods and has a serious chat with them about how friends and family solve problems and take care of one another. However, after giving the animals a talking to, he chortles under his breath at the notion of "Cows and chickens runnin' wild in the woods." The understated tone of the text is supported perfectly by the humorous ink-and-watercolor illustrations, from the serious countenance of Farmer Fred, mirrored in the animals' faces to their antics to his ever-so-slight smile. The author/illustrator dares his audience not to smile, but he can't be taken too seriously.-Carolyn Janssen, Children's Learning Center of the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, OH<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Dream Spheres (Forgotten Realms: Songs and Swords, Book 5)</h2><p>Welcome to Waterdeep<br><br>Here, everything imaginable is for sale.

He has one case left over from his predecessor&#x2014;the brutal rape-murder of Pure Jade, the daughter of Butcher Hsai who lived on Half Moon Street. Her lover has been accused and is on the verge of being convicted, but Judge Dee senses that all is not right and sets out with his lieutenants to find the real murderer.<br><br>"So scrupulously in the classic Chinese manner yet so nicely equipped with everything to satisfy the modern reader."&#x2014;<i>New York Times</i><br><br>Robert Van Gulik (1910-67) was a Dutch diplomat and an authority on Chinese history and culture. He drew his plots from the whole body of Chinese literature, especially from the popular detective novels that first appeared in the seventeenth century.</p><p><p>Robert Van Gulik was born in the Netherlands in 1910. He was educated at the Universities of Leyden and Utrecht, and served in the Dutch diplomatic service in China and Japan for many years. His interest in Asian languages and art led him to the discovery of Chinese detective novels and to the historical character of Judge Dee, famous in ancient Chinese annals as a scholar-magistrate. Van Gulik subsequently began writing the Judge Dee series of novels that have so captivated mystery readers ever since. He died of cancer in 1967.</p>"Taken together, the Judge Dee series gives a unique and entertaining look at China in the age when Buddhism was first taking root. Those interested in ordinary--and sometimes extraordinary--life in the Tang dynasty, and anyone who just loves a good mystery, will find much here to enjoy." (Dan Zigmond <i>Tricycle</i>)<br><br>"When you're ready to cuddle up with a good book over the holidays, you will find no better companion than Dee. . . .A historical figure from seventh century Tang dynasty China, he comes to your living room or airplane seat courtesy of one Robert van Gulik . . . who penned a series of novels fictionalizing the exploits of what you might well think of as a Chinese Sherlock Holmes. . . . If you have an interest in ancient China or simply wish to better understand that country today, van&nbsp;Gulik's <i>Judge Dee</i> novels are especially attractive, but even without that dimension, they are truly addicting. As with any truly great crime fiction, the fifteen-odd novels and additional short stories reveal the great and true of the human condition along with the loathsome and the petty."

In the 1960s he founded Habitat - the chain of homeware stores that brought good, modern design within reach of the general population for the very first time. Over the subsequent 50 years Terence built another group of companies centred around design, retailing, restaurants and hotels. Today, Conran owns restaurants and shops in eight cities throughout the world and a design business serving many international clients that includes architecture and interior design, product and graphic design and brand licensing. In January 2011 Conran began working with Marks &amp; Spencer in the UK, designing an exclusive range of homewares for the store. In 2012 Conran signed a deal to collaborate with US retail giant jcpenney to design an exclusive range of furniture, lighting and accessories for the home. The initial collection launched in spring 2013 into 300 jcpenney stores throughout the US and there will be new ranges launching each spring and autumn. Terence was knighted for his services to design in 1983 and has been provost of the Royal College of Art in London. In 1982 he opened the very first museum in the world dedicated to design, which is now the celebrated Design Museum in London, due to move to new premises in 2015 thanks to a massive expansion programme.Conran's completely revised edition of The House Book (1976) offers comprehensive coverage of all aspects of design and decoration from structural and architectural aspects of the exterior to interior finishes and style. Extensive checklists help the reader assess design needs and to plan for layout, storage, and heating. Room by room, the lucid text details potential problems and gives inspiring solutions to the specifics of flooring, lighting, furniture, accessories, and space planning. Over 750 handsome color photographs illustrate the diversity of Conran's ideas. A final section, "Essentials," adds much practical advice on safety, utilities, maintenance, and design for the disabled. This wide-ranging sourcebook follows the same useful lines as its companion volumes, The Kitchen Book and The Bed and Bath Book. Highly recommended.

Happily, the members of the Bible group are anything but cookie-cutter, which suits Cooper just fine. There&#x2019;s a blind folk artist, a playboy meteorologist, an investment banker with a sweet tooth, an ambitious realtor, and a cute shy web designer who just might be &#x201c;the one&#x201d; for Cooper. But the member of Hope Street Church who invited Cooper to join this motley crew&#x2014;an office worker who got her wedding ring stuck in a copier&#x2014;is something else altogether:<i> She&#x2019;s dead And her husband is suspected of murder!<br><br></i>The Sunrise gang jumps into action, vowing to solve this unholy mess&#x2014;with God&#x2019;s guidance&#x2014;and Cooper&#x2019;s snooping...<br><br>Includes heavenly recipes from Mrs. Lee&#x2019;s kitchen!</p></p><p><p><b>JENNIFER STANLEY</b>&nbsp;has a BA in English from Franklin &amp; Marshall College, an MA in English Literature from West Chester University, and an MLIS from North Carolina Central University.

She drove all over the city of Richmond to fix them. By the time she got to these copiers, laminators, or fax machines as they waited in their offices, hospitals, or schools, they were broken. Broken and quiet. Cooper would arrive and meticulously lay out her tools, and as she did so, the machines didn&#x2019;t raise their brows in surprise or barely concealed amusement that a woman worked as an office- machine repairman. A thirty- two- year- old woman dressed in a man&#x2019;s uniform shirt didn&#x2019;t seem odd or funny to them at all. <br>Most importantly, they never stared at her eyes. <br>Her left eye&nbsp; wasn&#x2019;t worth a second look. It was a fl at, almost colorless blue. No one would have dreamed of comparing it to sapphires or deep seas or cloudless sum�mer skies. But the other eye, the eye Cooper had received through ocular transplant surgery after being smashed in the face with a field hockey stick in junior high, was a shimmering green. It was exotic&#x2014;invoking images of lush jungles flecked with fi refly light or the green shallows of tropical waters, in which sunshine was trapped just below the surface. <br>That single moment at field hockey practice, when a girl on Cooper&#x2019;s own team had accidentally swung her stick too high as she prepared to hit the ball with incredible force, made Cooper more self-conscious than other teenag�ers. Still, she wanted what most people want. She longed to have one close friend, to be loved by someone she could grow old with, and for her life to have purpose. Cooper thought she had found all of those in her boyfriend, Drew. Until he dumped her. <br>Shaking off her gloomy thoughts, Cooper cut a piece of crumb cake for breakfast, wrapped it in a paper towel, filled her twenty-eight-ounce travel cup to the brim with milky, unsweetened coffee, and tossed a banana onto the passenger seat of her truck. She drove east on I-64, the sun blinding her most of the way. According to Bryant Shel�ton&#x2019;s weather report, there&nbsp; wasn&#x2019;t going to be a cloud in the sky this April Friday. For once, it appeared as though Bryant might be right, though it didn&#x2019;t matter much to Cooper. She&#x2019;d be inside offi ces most of the day, but could enjoy brief moments of sunshine while driving the work van from one destination to another. <br>At ten minutes to nine, Cooper pulled into the parking lot belonging to one of a dozen corporate buildings re�sembling silvery LEGO blocks. The Make It Work! head�quarters was on the fringe of an area called Innsbrook in which hundreds of different companies, replete with an abundance of office equipment, depended upon Coo�per and her coworkers in order to operate smoothly. <br>&#x201c;Mornin&#x2019;, Coop!&#x201d; Angela called out a chipper greeting as Cooper approached the reception desk. Angela&#x2019;s smile, combined with a vase filled with plump, yellow roses, created a warm welcome. Few people visited the offi ce as most of Make It Work!&#x2019;s transactions were conducted via telephone, but Angela bought a dozen roses every Mon�day, claiming that a good workweek always began with fresh flowers. Angela was in charge of setting up appoint�ments and billing. She was at her desk every morning before anyone&nbsp; else, wearing one of her vintage sweaters, a pencil skirt (both of which&nbsp; were always too tight), and a pair of sexy heels. Angela&#x2019;s platinum hair, powdered face, and fire-engine-red nails and lipstick were supposed to call to mind an image of Marilyn Monroe, but Angela was older and plumper than the late actress had ever been. Still, Angela was the heart and soul of their small opera�tion. Filled with pluck and boundless optimism, even the frostiest customers thawed once Angela worked her magic on them. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got an emergency waitin&#x2019; for you, sug.&#x201d; Angela examined her reflection in a small compact that was never out of reach. &#x201c;Some poor lady has gotten her weddin&#x2019; ring jammed in the insides of a copier.&#x201d; She held out a pink memo pad and ripped off the top sheet with a fl ourish. <br>&#x201c;Capital City, huh?&#x201d; Cooper said, reading the mes�sage. &#x201c;I have to go over there anyway. They&#x2019;ve ordered half a dozen Hewlett-Packard 7410 multifunction printers and I&#x2019;ve got to bring them to Building F and hook them up.&#x201d; She grinned at Angela. &#x201c;A wedding ring, you say? I wonder how she got it stuck inside.&#x201d; <br>Angela shrugged. &#x201c;You know folks like to try to fi x things themselves. You&#x2019;ve fished stranger things out of those machines. &#x2019;Member the bologna sandwich last year?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Do I?&#x201d; Cooper laughed. &#x201c;That mayo was everywhere. And that obnoxious executive tried to blame it on his ad�ministrative assistant. What a jerk.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I like workin&#x2019; for Mr. Farmer. He&#x2019;s just as kind as he can be.&#x201d; Angela&#x2019;s eyes, beneath their curtain of long, fake lashes, twinkled as they always did when she mentioned the boss&#x2019;s name. <br>Cooper buttoned up her gun-smoke gray Make It Work! uniform jacket and grabbed the keys to one of the company&#x2019;s two vans. Ben, the other repairman, was al�ready off on his rounds. He came in an hour earlier than Cooper and was out of the door by 4:00 p.m. He was ob�sessed with developing his naturally thin frame into a walking mass of muscle, so he spent two hours at the gym before heading home to his wife&#x2014;a woman that no one from Make It Work! had ever laid eyes on. Ben never spoke about her either. <br>&#x201c;Can you grab some Mexican from Casa Grande for lunch?&#x201d; Angela asked as Cooper opened the front door, wiggling the van keys until they sounded like metal cas�tanets. <br>&#x201c;Sure. What would you like?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Chicken quesadillas for me, something for yourself, and a Pan Filo burrito for Mr. Farmer. He said he needed to be more like Ben and watch his weight but I told him that a little stuffing makes a nicer pillow.&#x201d; Angela giggled, placed a twenty-dollar bill on the desk, and pushed it to�ward Cooper. &#x201c;Lord, he turned beet red when I said that!&#x201d; <br>Cooper thought about her introverted boss being com�plimented by the effusive Angela. He was a man of few words and usually hid in his offi ce, drooling over the lat�est issues of Technology Review, Pop u lar Mechanics, and PC Magazine. Cooper&nbsp; couldn&#x2019;t fathom why Angela found their short, balding, hermitlike employer so captivating. It was like having a crush on Danny DeVito. <br>&#x201c;See you in a bit, Angela.&#x201d; Cooper saluted the other woman with her coffee cup and headed out to the van. <br>A Mrs. Brooke Hughes of Capital City, one of the na�tion&#x2019;s largest credit card companies, had placed the call regarding the lost wedding ring. Cooper could tell that Mrs. Hughes was either an administrative assistant or an investigative agent in the Fraud Protection Division by the fact that the copier in question was located on the third floor in Building C. The Fraud Protection Division took up most of that floor, with the exception of a large fi ling room Cooper had never had reason to enter. <br>The second the elevator doors opened on the third floor, Mrs. Hughes leapt forward and latched onto Coo�per&#x2019;s arm like a barnacle. <br>&#x201c;Thank goodness you&#x2019;re&nbsp; here!&#x201d; she exclaimed. Then, she looked down and realized she was held clamping onto Cooper&#x2019;s arm with a viselike grip and that the younger woman was politely struggling to reclaim her limb. &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m sorry!&#x201d; Exhaling loudly, she released Cooper and then displayed her hands, which&nbsp; were coated with black toner. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve really made a mess of things, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d; <br>Cooper could see that the woman had also smeared toner on her ivory blouse and berry-colored skirt. Mrs. Hughes, though agitated, had a friendly face and kind eyes. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; Cooper assured the woman and then introduced herself. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get your ring back. Which machine is it stuck in?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, please call me Brooke. The copier&#x2019;s right outside my offi ce.&#x201d; <br>Although she wore a name tag, Cooper thought it only polite to speak her name aloud since her client had estab�lished a friendly rapport, despite her distress. <br>It turned out that Brooke Hughes was the head of the entire department. She had her own assistant and a full- sized six-thousand-dollar Sharp grayscale copier at her disposal. The chair at the assistant&#x2019;s desk was empty and her workstation was covered with mounds of wadded tis�sues and untidy stacks of paper. <br>&#x201c;Cindi, my assistant, called out sick today. Again.&#x201d; Brooke&#x2019;s eyebrows shot up and down suggestively. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been trying to wrap up this case I&#x2019;m working on and I just needed to pull together a few more documents.&#x201d; She ges�tured at Cindi&#x2019;s desk. &#x201c;I was attempting to make sense of that mess when I came across a document that was very, very incriminating . . .&#x201d; She trailed off, looking abashed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to go on about all this to you.&#x201d; She lowered her voice to a whisper. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that it was crucial for me to make multiple copies of this, ah, report so I could quickly store it in more than one location as soon as possible.&#x201d; <br>Brooke nervously picked at her cuticles and lowered her voice even further. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m concerned that the original document could suddenly disappear.&#x201d; Her voice returned to normal as she continued. &#x201c;But then the copier jammed and I was so desperate to make copies that I tried to fi x it.

He lives with his wife, Jenny, and their two sons in Portland, Oregon.</p>Chapter One: Romulus, Stardate 56828.8<br><br>"This must be your first visit to Ki Baratan," said the woman who stood behind the operative.<br><br><i>So much for hiding in plain sight,</i> the operative thought, quietly abandoning his hope that she would pay him as little heed as had the throngs of civilians and military officers he'd already passed along the city's central <i>eyhon.</i> He turned and regarded her, averting his gaze momentarily from the graceful, blood-green dome of the Romulan Senate building. The ancient structure gleamed behind him in the morning sun, reflecting an aquamarine glint from the placid Apnex Sea that lay just beyond it.<br><br>"As a matter of fact, this <i>is</i> my first visit," the operative said. He smiled broadly, confident that the woman wouldn't sense how awkward this particular mannerism felt to him. "Before today, I had seen the greatness of Dartha only in my grandfather's holos."<br><br>As she studied him, he noted that she was old and gray. Her clothing was drab and shapeless, her lined countenance stern, evidently forged by upwards of two centuries of hard life circumstances. He watched impassively as she ran her narrowed, suspicious gaze over his somewhat threadbare traveling cassock.<br><br>"Dartha?" the woman said, still scrutinizing him. "Nobody has referred to the Empire's capital by <i>that</i> name since Neral came to power."<br><br>The operative silently cursed himself even as he concealed his frustration beneath a carefully cultivated mask of impassivity. Though his lapse was an understandable one -- roughly akin, he thought, to confusing Earth's nineteenth-century Constantinople with twentieth-century Istanbul -- he upbraided himself for it nonetheless.<br><br>"Forgive me, <i>'lai,"</i> he said, using the traditional rustic form of address intended to show respect to an elder female. "I arrived just today, from Leinarrh. In the Rarathik District."<br><br>An indulgent, understanding smile tugged at her lips. "Just what I thought. I took you for a <i>hveinn</i> right away. A farmer who's never left the <i>waith</i> before."<br><br>The operative forced his own smile to broaden, reassured that she found his rural Rarathik dialect convincing. He maintained his caution, however; like him, this apparently harmless old woman might not be at all what she appeared to be. "At your service, <i>'lai.</i> You may call me Rukath."<br><br>She nodded significantly yet discreetly toward the dome -- and the disruptor-carrying guards that walked among the green, ruatinite-inlaid minarets that surrounded it. "Then allow me to give you some friendly advice, Rukath of Leinarrh. Continue gawking so about the Hall of State, and I might have to call you 'dead.' Or perhaps worse."<br><br>The operative allowed his smile to collapse, which actually came as a relief. He feigned innocent fear, per his extensive intelligence and tactical training. "Do you really think those uhlans over there would actually <i>shoot</i> me? Just for <i>looking?"</i><br><br>"Just pray that the cold fingers of Erebus find you too unimportant to snatch away into the underworld," she said with a pitying shake of the head. <i>"Daold klhu."</i><br><br><i>Tourists,</i> the operative silently translated the unfamiliar Romulan term as the old woman turned and walked away. "Jolan'tru, <i>'lai,"</i> he said to her retreating back.<br><br>He turned back toward the Senate Dome and watched as the guards made their rounds. He counted six at the moment, marching in pairs, their arrogant, disciplined gazes focused straight ahead. The old woman's warning notwithstanding, he might as well have been invisible to them.<br><br><i>But it's best not to become complacent,</i> he thought, checking the chrono built into the disguised subspace pulse transmitter he wore on his wrist. Time was growing short. Since his surreptitious arrival on Romulus the previous day, he had taken in sights very few of his people had ever seen.<br><br>He'd just paid what might well turn out to be a once-in-a-lifetime visit to the Romulan capital of Ki Baratan. Now the time had come to venture beneath it.<br><br>The operative deliberately set aside unpleasant thoughts of the underworld of ancient Romulan mythology. Those old stories hadn't sufficiently described the noisome smells that were wafting up around him from the figurative -- and literal -- bowels of Ki Baratan. <i>Erebus, indeed.</i><br><br>Guided through the stygian gloom by his wrist light, the operative was relieved to note that the venerable maze of <i>aekhhwi'rhoi</i> -- the stone-lined sewer tunnels that ran below Ki Baratan -- corresponded precisely to the maps the defector M'ret had provided to Starfleet Intelligence. Carefully stepping over and past countless scuttling, multilegged, sewer-dwelling <i>nhaidh,</i> he made his way to the appointed place. Once there, he pulled hard at a rust-covered, meter-wide wheel, laboriously opening up a narrow access hatchway that looked to be older than Surak and T'Karik combined. The corroded steel aperture groaned in protest, moving only fractionally as the muscles in his back strained. After perhaps a minute of hard coaxing, the wheel gave way and the hatch opened with a clang that reverberated loudly throughout the catacombs.<br><br>Releasing the wheel, he pulled a small disruptor pistol from beneath his cassock, then squeezed through the narrow opening without making any further pretense of stealth; by now whoever else might be down here, whether friend or foe, was surely aware of his presence.<br><br>He passed into the darkened chamber beyond the hatch, where air that reeked of stagnation, moldy old bones, and damp earth assailed his nostrils. Stepping forward, he heard a quiet yet stern male voice.<br><br>"Halt! Drop your weapon." Something cool and unyielding pressed forcefully into the small of his back.<br><br>The operative released his grip on the weapon, allowing it to clatter to the rough stone floor. A bright light suddenly shone before him, momentarily triggering his nictitating inner eyelids. He caught a glimpse of several humanoid silhouettes standing before him, several meters farther inside the cavern's depths.<br><br>"State your name," said the voice behind him. It sounded young, almost adolescent. <i>Or perhaps merely frightened?</i> "And state your business here."<br><br>The operative knew that this was the moment of truth, and very possibly the last moment of his life. He faced that prospect with a Vulcan's ingrained equanimity.<br><br>"While on Romulus, I am known as Rukath."<br><br>"Of Leinarrh, in far-off Rarathik," someone else said, in a stern female voice. "By way of Starfleet Intelligence. Yes, we knew you were coming."<br><br>The operative nodded. "Then you already know my business here. I expected no less."<br><br>He felt the weapon at his back quiver slightly, and he calculated his odds of disarming the man behind him. They weren't at all good. Nevertheless, the time had come to end the standoff, regardless of the outcome.<br><br>"I also bring greetings from Federation starship <i>Alliance.</i> Captain Saavik sends her best regards to the movement. And to the ambassador, of course."<br><br>As the operative had hoped, the mention of the ambassador's wife prompted one of the silhouettes before him to detach itself from the others and step forward. The tall, lean form spoke in a graveled yet resonant voice that he recognized instantly, even though more than eight decades had passed since he had last heard it.<br><br>"Lower your weapon, D'Tan. Rukath is among friends."<br><br>"But how can we be certain this Rukath is a friend? If that's even his name."<br><br>The figure stepped forward another several paces, and waved an arm in what was obviously a prearranged signal. In response, the light levels diminished, allowing the operative to see the approaching man's face clearly, as well as the coterie of a half-dozen armed Romulan civilians, an even mix of men and women, who stood vigilantly all around him.<br><br><i>Ambassador Spock.</i><br><br>The tall, conspicuously unarmed figure came to a stop only a meter away, his hands folded in front of his simple hooded pilgrim's robe as he studied the operative's face. The operative recalled his only previous meeting with the ambassador, whose saturnine visage was umistakable despite the addition of a great many new lines and wrinkles. He wondered if Spock remembered him as well, after the passage of so many years. Perhaps the minor surgical alterations that had been wrought on his facial structure obscured his identity.<br><br>"Your vigilance is an asset to us, D'Tan," Spock said to the young man with the weapon. "But as Surak teaches us, there can be no progress without risk."<br><br>That evidently got through to the armed man, who withdrew his weapon and backed away. The operative spared a quick glance over his shoulder, nodding toward Spock's youthful bodyguard in a manner that he hoped would be taken as nonthreatening and reassuring. He noted the other man's response: a hard scowl and a still-unholstered disruptor.<br><br>The operative fixed his gaze once again upon Spock, a man who had achieved great notoriety back on Vulcan -- as well as throughout the Federation and beyond -- more than a century earlier. <i>How strange,</i> he thought, <i>that one who never even achieved Kolinahr now represents all of Vulcan here in this forbidding place -- and attempts to bring such radical change to both Vulcan and Romulus.</i> He wondered if Spock would have taken on such a task had he attained the pinnacle of logic that the Kolinahr disciplines represented.<br><br><i>Would I have been so foolish to have followed him here had Kolinahr not eluded me also?</i><br><br>"Walk with me, please, Rukath," Spock said, then abruptly turned to stride more deeply into the rough-hewn cavern that stretched beyond the sewer hatch. The operative immediately fell into step beside the ambassador. He heard the crunch of gravel behind him, as Spock's followers tailed the pair at a respectful distance. <i>If I really were the Tal Shiar or military intelligence infiltrator these people fear that I am, this mission would surely be a suicide run.</i><br><br>"You must forgive D'Tan," Spock said.<br><br>"There is nothing to forgive, Mr. Ambassador. His caution is understandable. The Tal Shiar's eyes and ears are everywhere."<br><br>"Indeed. And none of us have forgotten Senator Pardek's betrayal."<br><br>The operative thought he detected a touch of wistfulness in the ambassador's tone. Though it was a surprising departure from Vulcan stoicism, he could certainly understand it. Though he had studied Captain Jean-Luc Picard's reports about Romulus -- one of which included Spock's own observation that reuniting the long-sundered Vulcan and Romulan peoples might take decades or even centuries to come to fruition -- it was disappointing to think that Spock's efforts had yielded so little after eleven years of hard, often perilous work.<br><br>As though he had surmised the dark turn the operative's thoughts had taken, Spock came directly to the point: "Tell me, Rukath: Why have you come to Romulus?"<br><br>The operative was not surprised to learn that Starfleet Intelligence might not have briefed Spock thoroughly on his reason for visiting Romulus. Or perhaps Spock was testing him, despite his reassurances to D'Tan.<br><br>"I bear an offer from the Federation Council," the operative said.<br><br>Though the cavern's illumination remained dim, the operative could see Spock's right eyebrow rise. "And the nature of that offer?"<br><br>"The council has decided to give its official endorsement to your agenda of Vulcan-Romulan unification. But both the council and the new president will want you to return to Earth to make a formal report first."<br><br>Spock brought their walk to an abrupt halt. His dark eyes flashed with an almost fanatical intensity. The operative wondered what so many years living among Vulcan's hyperemotional cousins had done to the ambassador's emotional disciplines. Had he "gone native"?<br><br>"My work is here," Spock said.<br><br>The operative raised a hand in a placating gesture. "You would be returned here, Mr. Ambassador, to resume that work as quickly as possible. After you've addressed both the council and the president's office on your progress."<br><br>Spock turned his gaze downward and stared into the middle distance, a deliberative expression on his face. "I see," he said after a pause. "To avail myself of an Earth idiom, the council evidently wishes me to 'come in from the cold.'"<br><br>Thanks to nearly a century of at least intermittent association with humans, the operative was conversant with the idiom Spock had used. "Yes, Mr. Ambassador. And the council will almost certainly place Federation resources at your disposal, at least covertly."<br><br>Spock paused again before responding. "Indeed. That would be a significant change in Federation policy."<br><br>"We live in changing times, Mr. Ambassador."<br><br>"Unquestionably. President Zife's sudden resignation is but one sign." Spock clasped his hands before him, steepling his index fingers. "I cannot help but wonder whether the council's offer is related to Zife's abrupt departure."<br><br>The operative was impressed by Spock's knowledge of the political landscape beyond the Romulan Neutral Zone, though he knew it shouldn't have surprised him; he reminded himself that the ambassador had made more than one brief return to Earth since beginning his work on Romulus.<br><br>"I'm afraid all I know about that is what's been on the newsnets," the operative said truthfully.<br><br>Spock nodded, his expression grave. The operative had no doubt that the ambassador was well acquainted with those same reports.<br><br>Sensing that the ambassador still required some additional persuasion, the operative said, "I will need to rendezvous with my transport this evening. If you will agree to accompany me, we can have you back in Federation space within days."<br><br>Something resembling a half-smile crossed Spock's face. "I trust, Rukath, that you aren't prepared to use force to return me to Earth."<br><br>The operative gestured toward D'Tan, whom he knew still stood -- disruptor in hand -- only a short distance behind him. "I am obviously in no position to force you to do anything, Mr. Ambassador. I had hoped you would agree to come to Earth voluntarily."<br><br>Spock very slowly shook his head. "I am pleased that the council has finally come to understand the necessity of the cause of reunification. But I cannot afford to abandon my work on Romulus, even temporarily. Especially now, while tensions between the Romulan Senate and one of the key Reman military factions continue to escalate."<br><br>The operative recalled yesterday's update about this very subject in his daily intelligence briefing. The mysterious Shinzon, the Reman faction's young leader, had led a number of successful military engagements against Dominion forces during the war. His sudden prominence in Romulan politics could cause unpredictable swings in the delicate balance of power within a senate now evenly divided on issues of war and peace.<br><br>"You wouldn't be away from Romulus for very long, sir," the operative said quietly.<br><br>"The local political landscape is far too volatile for me to leave now. In addition to the unpredictability of the Reman faction, there are rumors of unrest on Kevatras and other Romulan vassal worlds. I dare not leave Romulus now, even for a short time."<br><br>The operative decided that the time had come to risk goading the ambassador into cooperating. "Has your unification movement progressed so little over the past decade that you remain completely indispensable to it even now?"<br><br>But clearly Spock wasn't taking the bait. Sidestepping the question, he said, "I must also consider two other possibilities. One is that you ac...</p><h2>Three Complete Novels: The Cat Who Wasn&#39;t There / The Cat Who Went into the Closet / The Cat Who Came to Breakfast</h2><p>Jim Qwilleran and his remarkable feline sleuths, Koko and Yum Yum, appear in a delightful trio of whodunits--The Cat Who Wasn&#39;t There, The Cat Who Went into the Closet, and The Cat Who Came to Breakfast--in an unabridged omnibus edition of the popular mysteries.</p><p></p><h2>Modern Classics Wind Sand and Stars</h2><p>Both a gripping tale of adventure and a poetic meditation, Antoine de Saint Exup�ry&#39;s Wind, Sand and Stars is the lyrical autobiography of an aviation pioneer, from the author of The Little Prince. This Penguin Modern Classics edition is translated from the French with an introduction by William Rees. In 1926 de Saint-Exup�ry began flying for the pioneering airline Lat�co�re - later known as A�ropostale - opening up the first mail routes across the Sahara and the Andes. Wind, Sand and Stars is drawn from this experience. Interweaving encounters with nomadic Arabs and other adventures into a richly textured autobiographical narrative, it has its climax in the extraordinary story of Saint-Exup�ry&#39;s crash in the Libyan Desert in 1936, and his miraculous survival. &#39;Self-discovery comes when a man measures himself against an obstacle,&#39; writes Saint-Exup�ry. This book explores the transcendent perceptions that arise when life is tested to its limits. Writer and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exup�ry (1900-44), was born in Lyon, France. His first two books, Southern Mail and Night Flight, are distinguished by a poetic evocation of the romance and discipline of flying. Later works, including Wind, Sand and Stars and Flight to Arras, stress his humanistic philosophy. Saint-Exup�ry&#39;s popular children&#39;s book The Little Prince is also read by adults for its allegorical meaning. Saint-Exup�ry&#39;s plane disappeared during a mission in World War II.

He trudged around the United States and England to gain converts for Mormonism, spoke in spiritual tongues, married more than fifty women, and eventually transformed a barren desert into his vision of the Kingdom of God. While previous accounts of his life have been distorted by hagiography or polemical expos�, John Turner provides a fully realized portrait of a colossal figure in American religion, politics, and westward expansion.</p><p><br></p><p><br>After the 1844 murder of Mormon founder Joseph Smith, Young gathered those Latter-day Saints who would follow him and led them over the Rocky Mountains. In Utah, he styled himself after the patriarchs, judges, and prophets of ancient Israel. As charismatic as he was autocratic, he was viewed by his followers as an indispensable protector and by his opponents as a theocratic, treasonous heretic.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Under his fiery tutelage, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints defended plural marriage, restricted the place of African Americans within the church, fought the U.S. Army in 1857, and obstructed federal efforts to prosecute perpetrators of the Mountain Meadows Massacre. At the same time, Young's tenacity and faith brought tens of thousands of Mormons to the American West, imbued their everyday lives with sacred purpose, and sustained his church against adversity. Turner reveals the complexity of this spiritual prophet, whose commitment made a deep imprint on his church and the American Mountain West.</p></p><p>John G. Turner is Assistant Professor of Religious Studies at George Mason University.In this superb new biography, Turner's strong narrative, human insight, knowledge of context, meticulous use of sources, and sophisticated appreciation of Mormon theology combine to create an account of his larger-than-life subject that is at once informative, judicious, and profoundly engaging. (Daniel Walker Howe, author of <i>What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815&#x2013;1848</i>)<br><br>A scholarly yet thoroughly readable historical/biographical study, of considerable interest to students of 19th-century American history and religious revivalism. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> 2012-05-01)<br><br>Turner provides a searing portrait of a leader at his most determined and&#x2014;at times&#x2014;ruthless in defense of his religion. A provocative and compelling view of one of the most elusive, yet influential, figures in our nation's westward expansion. (Ken Verdoia, author of <i>Utah: The Struggle for Statehood</i>)<br><br>The story Turner tells in this elegantly written biography will startle and shock many readers. He reveals a Brigham Young more violent and coarse than the man Mormons have known. While lauding his achievements as pioneer, politician, and church leader, the book will require a reassessment of Brigham Young the man. (Richard Bushman, author of <i>Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling</i>)<br><br>Inextricably tied together by bonds of fate and faith, Brigham Young and Mormonism rose as one in nineteenth-century America. It is that America, as well as that man and that religion, that Turner explores and explains so well in this wonderful book. (William Deverell, Director, Huntington&#x2013;USC Institute on California and the West)<br><br>Turner's treatment of the complex Brigham Young is unsentimental, cogent, critical, and fair. It takes its place alongside Leonard Arrington's magisterial <i>American Moses</i> as the essential, mutually challenging portraits of one of America's greatest colonizers and religious figures. (Philip L. Barlow, author of <i>Mormons and the Bible: The Place of the Latter-day Saints in American Religion</i>)<br><br>Turner's broad historical perspective clarifies why Young's ecclesiastical successors have still felt the man's influence--even after abandoning polygamy. An impressively detailed portrait of a controversial giant. (Bryce Christensen <i>Booklist (starred review)</i> 2012-08-01)<br><br>A definitive biography of Mormonism's greatest activist and apostle. (Adam Gopnik <i>New Yorker</i> 2012-08-13)<br><br>Previous biographers of Brigham Young have used epithets such as 'American Moses' and 'Lion of the Lord.' However, what Turner demonstrates here is that the three-dimensional Young cannot be reduced to saint or tyrant; he was bold, brave, crude, petty, visionary, manipulative, creative, charismatic, kindly, and much more besides. He presents Young as a family man navigating the complexities of polygamy, as a leader moving large numbers of people across the Great Plains, and as a politician negotiating enough independence for the Mormons from the American government that he could build the kingdom of God as he saw fit. Turner was given unprecedented access to the LDS church archives and he makes full use of them and other sources, as well as providing a cogent interpretive context. It is easy to forget Young's significance in American history, but at a minimum it needs to be remembered that he is responsible for settling a vast swath of the West. Turner gives him his due... There aren't enough superlatives for this book. It will remain the standard biography for a long time. Because of its thorough documentation, academics will take it seriously, while general readers will appreciate its clarity of prose and argument. (D. S. Azzolina <i>Library Journal (starred review)</i> 2012-08-01)<br><br>[A] magnificent new biography...[Turner's] book should establish him as one of the best religious historians of his generation. Turner had unfettered access to Young's papers, and his keen eye for social context makes this book an excellent introduction to the story of Mormonism as well as an essential addition to the history of the American West. It should also do for Brigham Young what Richard Lyman Bushman's Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling did for the Mormon prophet: make the case not only that Young was one of the most fascinating people of the 19th century but also that his importance in American history can no longer be overlooked. Indeed, some of that history will have to be revised to fit this "pioneer prophet" into its narrative...Turner's prose is so smooth and his interpretations so balanced that I suspect Mormonism's defenders and detractors alike will flock to this book...Turner is not a member of the Mormon church, which makes his achievement all the more remarkable.

Many people are negligent about getting enough sleep because they don't truly understand the benefits they could be getting from it. Once you understand the advantages of getting high-quality sleep, you'll be passionate about to putting these strategies into action for yourself.<br><br>So what is sleep? And why is it important?<br><br>Well, defining sleep is a lot like trying to define life. No one completely understands it, and if you try to explain it, you're more likely to sound like Forrest Gump than a world-renown scholar. (Life is like a box of chocolates . . . sleep is like pretending to be dead.)<br><br>The Free Dictionary defines sleep as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br><br>That sounds a little weird, but the most important takeaway is that it's a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body. If you're not doing it, then you're being completely unnatural. And nobody likes unnatural people.<br><br>What's more important is knowing the big prizes that sleep gives you. Generally, being awake is catabolic (breaks you down) and being asleep is anabolic (builds you up). Sleep is known to be an elevated anabolic state, heightening the growth and rejuvenation of the immune, skeletal, and muscular systems. Basically, sleep rebuilds you and keeps you youthful.<br><br>High-quality sleep fortifies your immune system, balances your hormones, boosts your metabolism, increases your physical energy, and improves the function of your brain. Unless you give your body the right amount of sleep, you will never, I repeat never, have the body and life you want to have.<br><br>In our culture, sleep is not respected very much at all. In fact, we are often programmed with the idea that to be successful, we need to work harder, we need to sleep less, and we can catch up on all the sleep we want when we're dead. To say sleep is not respected is really an understatement.<br><br>Working hard is unarguably a big part of being successful, but so is working smart. So many people in our world today go on plugging away with work, burning the candle at both ends, not realizing that the quality of work they're doing is being radically compromised. Research shows that after just 24 hours of sleep deprivation, there is an overall reduction of 6 percent in glucose reaching the brain. Simple translation: You get dumber.<br><br>This is also why you crave candy, chips, doughnuts, and other starchy, sugary things when you're sleep deprived. Your body is trying to compel you to get that glucose back to your brain as soon as possible. It's a built-in survival mechanism. This is inherent in our genes because, in our days as hunter-gatherers, that lack of brainpower could mean a swift death from a predator or a substantially reduced ability to hunt and procure our own food for survival. Today, a simple trip to the refrigerator can bypass your body's cry for more sleep, but those stress mechanisms are still alive and well within your body right now.<br><br>I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THAT LAST NIGHT<br><br>The most valuable takeaway from this sleep deprivation "brain drain" discovery is that the reduction in glucose isn't shared equally. Your parietal lobe and the prefrontal cortex actually lose 12 to 14 percent of their glucose when you don't sleep. These are the areas of the brain we most need for thinking, for distinguishing between ideas, for social control, and for being able to tell the difference between right and wrong. Have you ever made a poor decision when you were up late at night that you wouldn't have made if your head was on right? Chances are you have.<br><br>It wasn't entirely your fault. Your brain was hijacked by a dumber (and slightly less attractive) version of yourself.<br><br>When you're sleep deprived, you are unknowingly setting up a steel cage match between your willpower and your biology. Sure, you might be committed to eating healthier, exercising more, or even choosing better relationships. But when your prefrontal cortex starts to shut down, if you've ever had a potato chip, if you've ever had sugary cereal, if you've ever had ice cream, your brain knows that it can find a quick source of glucose in those things and shuttle it back to where it is needed. Your willpower is now in a judo-style armbar as your entire body will compel you to seek those foods out.<br><br>The next thing you know, you have cheesy fingertips from jamming down a whole bag of cheese puffs, or you find yourself looking down the barrel of an empty pint of ice cream. Upset and defeated, you blame yourself, not realizing that you were set up for failure in the first place. When you are tired, you are not yourself. Well, at least not the best version of yourself. Being sleep-deprived will automatically stack the deck against you.<br><br>By sleeping smarter, you're going to be able to stack the conditions in your favor and put healthy choices on autopilot. You're going to get a ton of tips and strategies to make that happen, but first we need to take a look at how that sleepy brain is affecting the rest of your life.<br><br>PUT IT TO THE TEST<br><br>A study published by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that poor sleep quality was equal to binge drinking and marijuana use in determining academic performance. The study reported that college students who were poor sleepers were much more likely to earn worse grades and even drop out of classes than their healthy sleeping peers.<br><br>Finding out that poor sleep can be as detrimental to learning as binge drinking should be a real eye-opener. Learning is a big part of our lives no matter what stage we're at. Our ability to learn and retain information is paramount to our success.<br><br>Whether we're in school or in the workforce, we'll often sacrifice sleep in the name of getting things done. But it's important to remember that there's a big difference between "working" and actually being effective.<br><br>By forgoing your sleep, you can absolutely do more work, but the quality and effectiveness of your work will be sacrificed. A study published in The Lancet that looked at a group of physicians proved that sleep-deprived individuals took 14 percent longer to complete a task and made 20 percent more errors than individuals who were well rested. Not only are we taking longer to do the same task, but we're going to have to spend even more time trying to go back to clean up the mess we've made.<br><br>If you learn to structure your time to get more sleep first, then you'll be able to get your work done faster and more effectively than if you zombie- walked your way through it. You'll be able to be more creative and energetic, and you'll have greater access to the parts of your brain responsible for problem-solving. The cultural idea of sleeping when you're dead will only accelerate the day that it becomes your reality. And the impact that sleep deprivation has on your brain will make your life a whole lot harder while you're still here to enjoy it.<br><br>YOUR BRAIN NEEDS A REHAB<br><br>Since the beginning of documented human history, philosophers and scientists alike have postulated what the real purpose of sleep is. Since it's this weird state that we're in, unconscious to the world around us, this would be the time that we'd be most vulnerable to danger and predation. From an evolutionary perspective, you'd think that we would have evolved out of sleep by now if it was making it tougher on our survival.<br><br>But what's been discovered is that sleep is actually what has enabled us to grow and evolve to the incredible level we have. Sleep hasn't been an evolutionary problem; it's been an evolutionary catalyst.<br><br>The human brain is the most powerful structure on the planet. It has enabled us to build our bodies and to build skyscrapers--to build automobiles and to build spaceships--to unlock the power of technology to create the Internet and to unlock the power of our DNA to understand life. Our brains can think externally of any new circumstance, analyze the past, forecast the future, and create limitless strategies to get there.<br><br>Billions of brain cells are controlling every function in your body as well. It's important to understand that each brain cell is capable of doing what your whole body does. These cells eat, communicate, reproduce, and even make waste. Scientists have discovered that this process of waste removal might be one of the biggest connections to our critical need for high-quality sleep.<br><br>Your body has what is essentially a cellular waste management system called the lymphatic system. It's responsible for eliminating metabolic waste and toxins to keep you healthy. However, the lymphatic system does not include your brain. This is because your brain is a closed system controlled by the blood-brain barrier, which decides what can go through and what cannot. Your brain is heavily guarded by cellular bouncers that can spot a fake ID a mile away.<br><br>Scientists have found that the brain actually has its own unique waste disposal system, similar to that of the lymphatic system. It's called the glymphatic system--with the added "g" as a special shout-out to the glial cells in the brain that control it.<br><br>All of the dynamic functions the human brain does result in a lot of waste products, all of which need to be removed. This waste removal literally makes room for new growth and development. Removing and recycling dead cells, tossing out toxins, and shuttling out waste is critical to brain function.<br><br>Researchers at the Center for Translational Neuromedicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center have discovered exactly how sleep relates to all of this. During sleep, the glymphatic system becomes 10 times more active than during wakefulness. Simultaneously, your brain cells are reduced in size by about 60 percent while you're asleep to make waste removal even more efficient.<br><br>Because your brain is so active while you're awake (learning, developing, and helping you to be awesome), it's continuously building up a lot of byproducts that are mainly removed by the restorative power of sleep.<br><br>If the waste removal system in your home gets backed up, then things are going to get real nasty, real fast. The same thing holds true if you're not sleeping well and your glymphatic system doesn't get to do its job. As a matter of fact, an inability of your brain to remove harmful waste products is believed to be one of the foundational causes of Alzheimer's disease.<br><br>DON'T SLEEP ON SLEEP<br><br>We've just covered a small slice of the pie on why sleep needs to be a top priority on your list from this day forward.<br><br>Always remember the value of your sleep. You will perform better, make better decisions, and have a better body when you get the sleep you require. Sleep is not an obstacle we need to go around. It's a natural state your body requires to boost your hormone function; heal your muscles, tissues, and organs; protect you from diseases; and make your mind work at its optimal level. The shortcut to success is not made by bypassing dreamland. You will work better, be more efficient, and get more stuff done when you're properly rested.<br><br>SLEEP<br><br>POWER TIP #1<br><br>When you know you have a big task, project, or event coming up, pull out a calendar and plan ahead how you can get your ideal number of sleep hours in. Oftentimes it's as simple as setting up a schedule. But people overlook it because, well, it's just too easy.<br><br>If it's important to you, you'll schedule it. Stick to that schedule as well as you can, and know that you will get the work done better and faster if you're more rested. We usually sacrifice our sleep to cram in more work because we didn't plan efficiently. And as the wise Benjamin Franklin said, "By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail."<br><br>SLEEP<br><br>POWER TIP #2<br><br>Begin reframing your idea of sleep. Instead of seeing sleep as an obstacle to work around (something you "have to" do), start seeing it as a special treat for yourself (something that you "get to" do) and love the entire process.<br><br>A real change begins with a simple change in your perception. Start to think of sleep as an incredible indulgence, like a sensuous dessert, a relaxing massage, a hot date with someone special, or something else that you really look forward to. "I've got a hot date with sleep tonight, and we are really going to get--it--on!" Start letting go of the stress surrounding sleep and allow yourself to enjoy it. You work hard enough in your life as it is. Treat yourself to some incredible sleep. You deserve it.<br><br>Now that we've gotten to the deeper connection as to why your sleep is so valuable, it's time to dive into the real nuts and bolts of sleeping smarter. You're about to be equipped with some powerhouse tools and tips that you'll be able to utilize for a lifetime of great sleep.

"I've always had this thing for cowboys, maybe because I was born in New Jersey,&#x201d; says the narrator in the collection&#x2019;s title story. &#x201c;But a real cowboy is hard to find these days, even in the West.&#x201d; Our heroines are part daredevil, part philosopher, all acute observers of the nuances of modern romance. They go where their cowboys go, they meet cowboys who don't look the part &#x2013; and they have staunch friends who give them advice when the going gets rough. <em>Cowboys Are My Weakness</em> is a refreshing and realistic look at men and women &#x2013; together and apart.</p><p>Pam Houston is the prize-winning author of Contents May Have Shifted, among other books. She is professor of English at the University of California&#x2013;Davis and lives on a ranch at 9,000 feet in Colorado near the headwaters of the Rio Grande.<p> <b>"How to Talk to a Hunter"</b> </p><p> When he says "Skins or blankets?" it will take you a moment to realize that he's asking which you want to sleep under. And in your hesitation he'll decide that he wants to see your skin wrapped in the big black moose hide. He carried it, he'll say, soaking wet and heavier than a dead man, across the tundra for two -- was it hours or days or weeks? But the payoff, now, will be to see it fall across one of your white breasts. It's December, and your skin is never really warm, so you will pull the bulk of it around you and pose for him, pose for his camera, without having to narrate this moose's death. </p><p> You will spend every night in this man's bed without asking yourself why he listens to top-forty country. Why he donated money to the Republican Party. Why he won't play back his messages while you are in the room. You are there so often the messages pile up. Once you noticed the bright green counter reading as high as fifteen. </p><p> He will have lured you here out of a careful independence that you spent months cultivating; though it will finally be winter, the dwindling daylight and the threat of Christmas, that makes you give in. Spending nights with this man means suffering the long face of your sheepdog, who likes to sleep on your bed, who worries when you don't come home. But the hunter's house is so much warmer than yours, and he'll give you a key, and just like a woman, you'll think that means something. It will snow hard for thirteen straight days. Then it will really get cold. When it is sixty below there will be no wind and no clouds, just still air and cold sunshine. The sun on the windows will lure you out of bed, but he'll pull you back under. The next two hours he'll devote to your body. With his hands, with his tongue, he'll express what will seem to you like the most eternal of loves. Like the house key, this is just another kind of lie. Even in bed; especially in bed, you and he cannot speak the same language. The machine will answer the incoming calls. From under an ocean of passion and hide and hair you'll hear a woman's muffled voice between the beeps. </p><p> <br> Your best female friend will say, "So what did you think? That a man who sleeps under a dead moose is capable of commitment?" </p><p> <br> This is what you learned in college: A man desires the satisfaction of his desire; a woman desires the condition of desiring. </p><p> The hunter will talk about spring in Hawaii, summer in Alaska. The man who says he was always better at math will form the sentences so carefully it will be impossible to tell if you are included in these plans. When he asks you if you would like to open a small guest ranch way out in the country, understand that this is a rhetorical question. Label these conversations future perfect, but don't expect the present to catch up with them. Spring is an inconceivable distance from the December days that just keep getting shorter and gray. </p><p> He'll ask you if you've ever shot anything, if you'd like to, if you ever thought about teaching your dog to retrieve. Your dog will like him too much, will drop the stick at his feet every time, will roll over and let the hunter scratch his belly. </p><p> <br> One day he'll leave you sleeping to go split wood or get the mail and his phone will ring again. You'll sit very still while a woman who calls herself something like Janie Coyote leaves a message on his machine: She's leaving work, she'll say, and the last thing she wanted to hear was the sound of his beautiful voice. Maybe she'll talk only in rhyme. Maybe the counter will change to sixteen. You'll look a question at the mule deer on the wall, and the dark spots on either side of his mouth will tell you he shares more with this hunter than you ever will. One night, drunk, the hunter told you he was sorry for taking that deer, that every now and then there's an animal that isn't meant to be taken, and he should have known that deer was one. </p><p> <br> Your best male friend will say, "No one who needs to call herself Janie Coyote can hold a candle to you, but why not let him sleep alone a few nights, just to make sure?" </p><p> <br> The hunter will fill your freezer with elk burger, venison sausage, organic potatoes, fresh pecans. He'll tell you to wear your seat belt, to dress warmly, to drive safely. He'll say you are always on his mind, that you're the best thing that's ever happened to him, that you make him glad that he's a man. </p><p> Tell him it don't come easy, tell him freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose. </p><p> <br> These are the things you'll know without asking: The coyote woman wears her hair in braids. She uses words like "howdy." She's man enough to shoot a deer. </p><p> <br> A week before Christmas you'll rent <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i> and watch it together, curled on your couch, faces touching. Then you'll bring up the word "monogamy." He'll tell you how badly he was hurt by your predecessor. He'll tell you he couldn't be happier spending every night with you. He'll say there's just a few questions he doesn't have the answers for. He'll say he's just scared and confused. Of course this isn't exactly what he means. Tell him you understand. Tell him you are scared too. Tell him to take all the time he needs. Know that you could never shoot an animal; and be glad of it. </p><p> <br> Your best female friend will say, "You didn't tell him you loved him, did you?" Don't even tell her the truth. If you do you'll have to tell her that he said this: "I feel exactly the same way." </p><p> <br> Your best male friend will say, "Didn't you know what would happen when you said the word 'commitment'?" </p><p> But that isn't the word that you said. </p><p> He'll say, "Commitment, monogamy, it all means just one thing." </p><p> <br> The coyote woman will come from Montana with the heavier snows. The hunter will call you on the day of the solstice to say he has a friend in town and can't see you. He'll leave you hanging your Christmas lights; he'll give new meaning to the phrase "longest night of the year." The man who has said he's not so good with words will manage to say eight things about his friend without using a gender-determining pronoun. Get out of the house quickly. Call the most understanding person you know who will let you sleep in his bed. </p><p> <br> Your best female friend will say, "So what did you think? That he was capable of living outside his gender?" </p><p> <br> When you get home in the morning there's a candy tin on your pillow. Santa, obese and grotesque, fondles two small children on the lid. The card will say something like "From your not-so-secret admirer." Open it. Examine each carefully made truffle. Feed them, one at a time, to the dog. Call the hunter's machine. Tell him you don't speak chocolate. </p><p> <br> Your best female friend will say, "At this point, what is it about him that you could possibly find appealing?" </p><p> Your best male friend will say, "Can't you understand that this is a good sign? Can't you understand that this proves how deep he's in with you?" Hug your best male friend. Give him the truffles the dog wouldn't eat. </p><p> <br> Of course the weather will cooperate with the coyote woman. The highways will close, she will stay another night. He'll tell her he's going to work so he can come and see you. </p><p> He'll even leave her your number and write "Me at Work" on the yellow pad of paper by his phone. Although you shouldn't, you'll have to be there. It will be you and your nauseous dog and your half-trimmed tree all waiting for him like a series of questions. </p><p> <br> This is what you learned in graduate school: In every assumption is contained the possibility of its opposite. </p><p> <br> In your kitchen he'll hug you like you might both die there. Sniff him for coyote. Don't hug him back. </p><p> He will say whatever he needs to to win. He'll say it's just an old friend. He'll say the visit was all the friend's idea. He'll say the night away from you has given him time to think about how much you mean to him. Realize that nothing short of sleeping alone will ever make him realize how much you mean to him. He'll say that if you can just be a little patient, some good will come out of this for the two of you after all. He still won't use a gender-specific pronoun. </p><p> Put your head in your hands. Think about what it means to be patient. Think about the beautiful, smart, strong, clever woman you thought he saw when he looked at you. Pull on your hair. Rock your body back and forth. Don't cry. </p><p> He'll say that after holding you it doesn't feel right holding anyone else. For "holding," substitute "fucking." Then take it as a compliment. </p><p> He will get frustrated and rise to leave. He may or may not be bluffing. Stall for time. Ask a question he can't immediately answer. Tell him you want to make love on the floor. When he tells you your body is beautiful say, "I feel exactly the same way." Don't, under any circumstances, stand in front of the door. </p><p> Your best female friend will say, "They lie to us, they cheat on us, and we love them more for it." She'll say, "It's our fault; we raise them to be like that." </p><p> Tell her it can't be your fault. You've never raised anything but dogs. </p><p> <br> The hunter will say it's late and he has to go home to sleep. He'll emphasize the last word in the sentence. Give him one kiss that he'll remember while he's fucking the coyote woman. Give him one kiss that ought to make him cry if he's capable of it, but don't notice when he does. Tell him to have a good night. </p><p> <br> Your best male friend will say, "We all do it. We can't help it. We're self-destructive. It's the old bad-boy routine. You have a male dog, don't you?" </p><p> <br> The next day the sun will be out and the coyote woman will leave. Think about how easy it must be for a coyote woman and a man who listens to top-forty country. The coyote woman would never use a word like "monogamy"; the coyote woman will stay gentle on his mind. </p><p> <br> If you can, let him sleep alone for at least one night. If you can't, invite him over to finish trimming your Christmas tree. When he asks how you are, tell him you think its a good idea to keep your sense of humor during the holidays. </p><p> Plan to be breezy and aloof and full of interesting anecdotes about all the other men you've ever known. Plan to be hotter than ever before in bed, and a little cold out of it. Remember that necessity is the mother of invention. Be flexible. </p><p> First, he will find the faulty bulb that's been keeping all the others from lighting. He will explain, in great detail, the most elementary electrical principles. You will take turns placing the ornaments you and other men, he and other women, have spent years carefully choosing. Under the circumstances, try to let this be a comforting thought. </p><p> He will thin the clusters of tinsel you put on the tree. He'll say something ambiguous like "Next year you should string popcorn and cranberries." Finally, his arm will stretch just high enough to place the angel on the top of the tree. </p><p> <br> Your best female friend will say, "Why can't you ever fall in love with a man who will be your friend?" </p><p> Your best male friend will say, "You ought to know this by now: Men always cheat on the best women." </p><p> <br> This is what you learned in the pop psychology book: Love means letting go of fear. </p><p> <br> Play Willie Nelson's "Pretty Paper." He'll ask you to dance, and before you can answer he'll be spinning you around your wood stove, he'll be humming in your ear. Before the song ends he'll be taking off your clothes, setting you lightly under the tree, hovering above you with tinsel in his hair. Through the spread of the branches the all-white lights you insisted on will shudder and blur, outlining the ornaments he brought: a pheasant, a snow goose, a deer. </p><p> The record will end. Above the crackle of the wood stove and the rasp of the hunter's breathing you'll hear one long low howl break the quiet of the frozen night: your dog, chained and lonely and cold. You'll wonder if he knows enough to stay in his doghouse. You'll wonder if he knows that the nights are getting shorter now. </p><p> </p><p>Copyright � 1992 by Pam Houston </p></p><h2>The Lego Ideas Book</h2><p>&#39;The LEGO Ideas Book&#39; is packed full of tips from expert LEGO builders on how to make jet planes reach new heights, create fantastic fortresses, swing through lush jungles, have fun on the farm and send space shuttles out of this world.</p><p>Daniel Lipkowitz is an editor and story developer for the LEGO Group.

Everest disaster vanished into thin air, one man had the courage to bring them down alive...<br><br>On May 10, 1996, two commercial expeditions headed by expert leaders attempted to scale the world's largest peak. But things went terribly wrong. Crowded conditions, bad judgement, and a bitter storm stopped many climbers in their tracks. Others were left for dead, or stranded on the frigid mountain. Anatoli Boukreev, head climbing guide for the Mountain Madness expedition, stepped into the heart of the storm and brought three of his clients down alive. Here is his amazing story-of an expedition fated for disaster, of the blind ambition that drives people to attempt such dangerous ventures, and of a modern-day hero, who risked his own life to save others..<br></p><p><i>The Climb</i> is Russian mountaineer Anatoli Boukreev's account of the harrowing May 1996 Mount Everest attempt, a tragedy that resulted in the deaths of eight people. The book is also Boukreev's rebuttal to accusations from fellow climber and author Jon Krakauer, who, in his bestselling memoir, <i>Into Thin Air</i>, suggests that Boukreev forfeited the safety of his clients to achieve his own climbing goals. Investigative writer and <i>Climb</i> coauthor G. Weston DeWalt uses taped statements from the surviving climbers and translated interviews from Boukreev to piece together the events and prove to the reader that Boukreev's role was heroic, not opportunistic. Boukreev refers to the actions of expedition leader Scott Fischer throughout the ascent, implying that factors other than the fierce snowstorm may have caused this disaster. This new account sparks debate among both mountaineers and those who have followed the story through the media and Krakauer's book. Readers can decide for themselves whether Boukreev presents a laudable defense or merely assuages his own bruised ego.This newest edition of the bestselling account of the 1996 Everest disaster now includes never before published transcripts of the climbers&#39; debriefing from the Everest base camp. This new material is a must for all followers of the Everest story and includes the climbers first reactions to events.</p><h2>The American Plate: A Culinary History in 100 Bites</h2><p><p>"Like many miniencyclopedias, this one is studded with often intriguing facts."&#x2015;<em>Kirkus</em></p><p><strong><em>New York Post </em>Required Reading and an E<em>ntertainment Weekly </em>Top 3 Must-Read!</strong></p><p>From the chief historian at HISTORY� comes a rich chronicle of the evolution of American cuisine and culture, from before Columbus's arrival to today.</p><p>Did you know that the first graham crackers were designed to reduce sexual desire?

Libby lives in New York City.<p><b>Introduction</b></p> <p>Imagine, for a minute, traveling to a foreign country and exploring that nation's culture. How might you hope to really understand the people-their traditions, their customs, and the flavors of their cuisine? You might visit museums, walk down city streets, or browse country markets. You would definitely eat the food there, because that is one of the best and often most surprising ways to learn about a different place.</p> <p>In some respects, the past is another country as well. It has flavors of its own that are well worth exploring. Experiencing those tastes reveals a time when the people and places of our own country were radically different than they are today. Like time travelers, we can see what life was like for our predecessors by conjuring up the techniques, textures, smells, and tastes of America from two hundred, three hundred, and even four hundred years ago.</p> <p>The remarkable changes in ingredients, recipes, and menus over the centuries provide a window for us to appreciate just how different life has been during the various eras of America's story. Exploring our food heritage can also heighten our sense of the differences and similarities between then and now. For example, beaver tail is likely too gamey and fatty for our modern palates, but hungry fur trappers in the colonial period dined on it happily. Conversely, warm pumpkin pudding with heavy cream still appeals to us today, just as it enticed new colonists in seventeenth-century Massachusetts. So while this book is primarily about the evolution of America's national cuisine and "foodways"-a term that includes growing, harvesting, preserving, preparing, cooking, and eating food-history provides the context for understanding the intersection of culture and cuisine.</p> <p>The American Plate provides a multilayered overview of the peopling of our country, our evolving foodways, and the transformation of our palates from 1400 to today. American Indians, Anglo-American women, enslaved (and free) African Americans, Chinese, Japanese, and Indian immigrants, western and eastern European arrivals, Hispanic families, and many more have contributed the flavors of their cultures to help create the variety of international and local influences we find in modern-day American restaurants, grocery stores, and kitchen tables.</p> <p>To understand how America's diverse, edible heritage developed, it's worth exploring the people and events that shaped our cuisine and left indelible marks on the foods we savor today. Where did the raw ingredients for what we think of as American food originate? Were all foods local and seasonal before the introduction of modern transportation and preservation technologies? Who cooked the food, and whose culture predominated in the kitchen? These are just a few of the many questions we'll explore in these pages.</p> <p>This book serves as a guide to introduce you to both an America of long ago and a more recent and familiar one, through more than one hundred different foods (or Bites) organized by ten eras of our national history. Drawing from a variety of sources, the book aims to shed light on the myriad cultures, values, and traditions that make up the United States through stories about our food (some very short, some longer). Peppered throughout are anecdotes, images, and recipes for all sorts of American dishes-from roast beaver tail and succotash to mint juleps, shoo fly pie, and firehouse chili.</p> <p>Each chapter and each Bite stands alone, so you may read this book from front to back or just start with a time period or specific food that interests you. I chose certain foods because they and their history provide a particularly clear lens through which to view our broader national history. Others exemplify or are symbolic of a specific event, such as a version of a WPA soup recipe from the Great Depression. My hope is that these narratives and recipes will inspire readers to explore America's diverse culinary heritage, whether by recreating the unfamiliar tastes of the past or simply enjoying the stories I've included here.</p> <p>Throughout America's history, nature, economics, technology, and immigration have played important roles in our adaptation of indigenous foods, development of new ones, and adoption of others from different continents. Ultimately, by learning about the origins of our richly diverse culinary heritage and exploring the history of the foodways included in this book, we can develop a deeper understanding of how we became the curious and passionate eaters we are today.</p></p><h2>The Life of Captain James Cook</h2><p>An authority on Pacific exploration analyzes the major influences on Cook&#39;s character and assesses his role and achievements as an explorer and seaman</p><p>The culmination of the life work of the most distinguished historian of Pacific exploration, this lavishly illustrated biography places Cook in the context of his times and affirms his eminence in the history of maritime discovery.John Cawte Beaglehole was born in Wellington and attended Victoria University College to which, after graduate work in London and a period of short-lived jobs and unemployment in the 1930s, he was to return as lecturer in history, senior research fellow and finally Professor of British Commonwealth History.

With its great feasts, its white stone churches, its merchant visitors from many lands, Sadko felt there was no better place to be. Yet he was lonely too, for the rich young ladies who danced to his music would never favor anyone so poor.&nbsp;One night he takes his twelve-string gusli and goes alone to play by the River Volkhov. Suddenly from the water rises the Sea King, who invites the astonished musician to play at his underwater palace. But how will Sadko get there? And how will he get back? And will he want to return at all, when he meets the Sea King's lovely daughter?&nbsp;One of the most popular legends of Russia, Sadko's story is found in medieval epic ballads, as well as in a popular opera by Rimsky-Korsakov. It is retold here in elegant prose, complemented by the entrancing illustrations of a modern Russian master.&nbsp;TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS -- A READER'S THEATER SCRIPT OF THIS BOOK IS AVAILABLE IN AARON'S BOOK "FOLKTALES ON STAGE," OR FREE ON AARON'S WEB SITE.&nbsp;/////////////////////////////////////////////////&nbsp;Aaron Shepard is the award-winning author of "The Baker's Dozen," "The Sea King's Daughter," "The Monkey King," and many more children's books.

The red sun shone dimly through the water above, while before him stood a white stone palace.&nbsp;Sadko passed through a coral gate. As he reached the huge palace doors, they swung open to reveal a giant hall. The elegant room was filled with guests and royal attendants -- herring and sprats, cod and flounder, gobies and sticklebacks, sand eels and sea scorpions, crabs and lobsters, starfish and squid, sea turtles and giant sturgeon.&nbsp;Standing among the guests were dozens of maidens -- river nymphs, the Sea King's daughters. On a shell throne at the end of the hall sat the Sea King and his Queen.&nbsp;"You're just in time!" called the King. "Musician, come sit by me -- and let the dance begin!"&nbsp;Sadko set his gusli on his lap and plucked a merry tune. Soon all the fish swam in graceful figures. The seafloor crawlers cavorted. The river maidens leaped and spun.&nbsp;"I like that tune!" declared the King. He jumped to the center of the hall and joined the dance. His arms waved, his robe swirled, his hair streamed, his feet stamped.&nbsp;"Faster!" cried the King. "Play faster!"&nbsp;Sadko played faster and the King's dance grew wilder. All the others stopped and watched in awe. Ever more madly did he move, whirling faster, leaping higher, stamping harder.&nbsp;The Sea Queen whispered urgently, "Musician, end your tune! It seems to you the King merely dances in his hall. But above us, the sea is tossing ships like toys, and giant waves are breaking on the shore!"&nbsp;Alarmed, Sadko pulled a string until it snapped. "Your Majesty, my gusli is broken."&nbsp;"A shame," said the Sea King, winding to a stop. "I could have danced for days. But a fine fellow you are, Sadko. I think I'll marry you to one of my daughters and keep you here forever."&nbsp;PICTURE BOOKS AND EASY READERS BY AARON SHEPARD&nbsp;THE BAKER'S DOZEN: A Saint Nicholas Tale.

More than one hundred years later, his great-grandson traveled back to find that&#x2014;mostly due to oil and natural gas discoveries&#x2014;it is now the richest. The circumstances of his return were serendipitous, as the notice that Dregni won a Fulbright Fellowship to go there arrived the same week as the knowledge that his wife Katy was pregnant. Braving a birth abroad and benefiting from a remarkably generous health care system, the Dregnis&#x2019; family came full circle when their son Eilif was born in Norway.</p><p>In this cross-cultural memoir, Dregni tells the hair-raising, hilarious, and sometimes poignant stories of his family&#x2019;s yearlong Norwegian experiment. Among the exploits he details are staying warm in a remote grass-roofed <i>hytte</i> (hut), surviving a dinner of <i>rakfisk</i> (fermented fish) thanks to 80-proof aquavit, and identifying his great-grandfather&#x2019;s house in the Lusterfjord only to find out it had been crushed by a boulder and then swept away by a river. To subsist on a student stipend, he rides the meat bus to Sweden for cheap salami with a busload of knitting pensioners. A week later, he and his wife travel to the Lofoten Islands and gnaw on klippefisk (dried cod) while cats follow them through the streets.</p><p>Dregni&#x2019;s Scandinavian roots do little to prepare him and his family for the year in Trondheim eating herring cakes, obeying the conformist <i>Janteloven</i> (Jante&#x2019;s law), and enduring the <i>m�rketid</i> (dark time). <i>In Cod We Trust</i> is one Minnesota family&#x2019;s spirited excursion into Scandinavian life. The land of the midnight sun is far stranger than they previously thought, and their encounters show that there is much we can learn from its unique and surprising culture.</p></p><p>Eric Dregni lives in Minneapolis, is dean of the Italian Concordia Language Village, and is assistant professor of English and journalism at Concordia University. He is the author of sixteen books, including four other titles from the University of Minnesota Press: Vikings in the Attic, Never Trust a Thin Cook and Other Lessons from Italy&#39;s Culinary Capital, Midwest Marvels, and Minnesota Marvels."Eric Dregni's spirited travel memoir to Norway joins that classic American genre&#x2014;the quest tale in search of family and ethnic roots. It's a special pleasure to see the Scandinavian immigration story teased out here with wit and acuity, the immigrant going the other way. <i>In Cod We Trust</i> is the story of a man not only looking for his family past but welcoming the next generation." &#x2014;Patricia Hampl<br><br>"A hilariously fun and moving read for anyone who has dreamed of returning to the Norwegian homeland." &#x2014;Walter Mondale<br><br>"Eric Dregni's deceptively delightful <i>In Cod We Trust</i> combines understated humor and serious scholarship. Readers will finish this book smiling, realizing they've been taught much about Norway's past and present&#x2014;including its model health care system&#x2014;while being entertained by a colicky baby testing his parents' patience. Part travelogue, part examination of how the immigrant experience affects generations on both sides of the Atlantic, Dregni's self-effacing Scandinavian style is a welcome treat." &#x2014;Arvonne Fraser</p><h2>L Is for Lawless</h2><p>"THIS IS ONE OF GRAFTON'S MOST FUN-TO-READ BOOKS. . . . One of [Kinsey Millhone's] wildest adventures yet."<br>--San Francisco Examiner<br>When Kinsey Millhone agrees to do a favor for Henry Pitts, her lovable octogenarian landlord, she literally gets taken for the ride of her life. The family of a recently deceased WWII veteran wants her to find out why the military has no record of his service. All Kinsey has to do, she thinks, is cut through some government red tape. But when the dead man's house is ransacked and his old army buddy is beaten up, she quickly realizes he was not all he seemed. Before long Kinsey is trailing crooks halfway across the country, impersonating a hotel maid, tangling with a baseball bat-wielding grandmother, and running from one very dangerous character. With her money almost gone and her nerves frayed, Kinsey's got to solve a decades-old crime and make it back home in time for Henry's wedding . . . if she can make it back at all. . . .</p><p>Both new readers and old fans will welcome this 12th Kinsey Milhone adventure in the <i>"A" is for Alibi</i> series by Sue Grafton. In this case, Kinsey agrees to do a favor for a friend of a friend and gets herself into so much trouble that she promises at the outset never to do such a thing again without careful consideration. <p> Henry Pitt, her longtime landlord asks her to help a fellow neighbor find evidence that his grandfather served in the military during the Second World War. With such proof, the man can be decently buried, courtesy of the U.S. government. It seems such a simple thing, but with Kinsey, it rarely is. Before long she finds herself entangled with an eccentric and quarrelsome family as well as a long lost buddy who has turned up just in time to get himself beaten up in a robbery attempt of the alleged veteran's apartment. It seems there is a reason the Armed Services have no record of the dead man's service. Kinsey sets out to determine what he might have been doing instead of fighting against the Japanese and why someone might think his shabby apartment worth a burgle. </p><p> Typical of the series, the mystery is not the central point of the story, but rather a starting point for Kinsey to become embroiled in a suspenseful (and delightful) search-and-rescue operation, usually against her better judgement. In this case, a gun-toting, arthritic octogenarian and revelations of the inner workings of bargain-rate motels are all part of the adventure. This is an easy and enjoyable read, and a solid addition to Grafton's string of alphabetical hits. <i>--K.A. Crouch</i></p>One of the nice things about a mystery series is that readers can become familiar with a character and anticipate his or her foibles and methods. I&#39;ve been following Sue Grafton&#39;s alphabet series for years, long before I came to Ballantine Books -- no, not compulsively starting with A is for Alibi, but close enough -- and it&#39;s been a pleasure to watch Kinsey Millhone, Grafton&#39;s series heroine, grow from one book to the next. It&#39;s also a pleasure to watch a writer not only become at ease with her character but hone her storytelling skills. Sue Grafton was good back when she began the series, and she&#39;s getting better -- and I, for one, am very glad she&#39;s only halfway through the alphabet. --Margaret Sanborn, Senior Publicity Copywriter</p><h2>The Apprentice</h2><p><b>The bestselling author of <i>The Surgeon</i> returns&#x2014;and so does that chilling novel&#x2019;s diabolical villain.

Charged with the responsibility of interpreting the Constitution, the nine unelected justices of the Court have the awesome power to strike down laws enacted by our elected representatives. Why does the public accept the Court&#x2019;s decisions as legitimate and follow them, even when those decisions are highly unpopular? What must the Court do to maintain the public&#x2019;s faith? How can the Court help make our democracy work? These are the questions that Justice Stephen Breyer tackles in this groundbreaking book.<br><br>Today we assume that when the Court rules, the public will obey. But Breyer declares that we cannot take the public&#x2019;s confidence in the Court for granted. He reminds us that at various moments in our history, the Court&#x2019;s decisions were disobeyed or ignored. And through investigations of past cases, concerning the Cherokee Indians, slavery, and <i>Brown v. Board of Education,</i> he brilliantly captures the steps&#x2014;and the missteps&#x2014;the Court took on the road to establishing its legitimacy as the guardian of the Constitution.<br><br>Justice Breyer discusses what the Court must do going forward to maintain that&nbsp;public confidence and argues for interpreting the Constitution in a way that works in practice.&nbsp;He forcefully rejects competing approaches that look exclusively to the Constitution&#x2019;s text or to the eighteenth-century views of the framers. Instead, he advocates a pragmatic approach that applies unchanging constitutional values to ever-changing circumstances&#x2014;an approach that will best demonstrate to the public that the Constitution continues to serve us well. The Court, he believes, must also respect the roles that other actors&#x2014;such as the president, Congress, administrative agencies, and the states&#x2014;play in our democracy, and he emphasizes the Court&#x2019;s obligation to build cooperative relationships with them.<br><br>Finally, Justice Breyer examines the Court&#x2019;s recent decisions concerning the detainees held at Guant�namo Bay, contrasting these decisions with rulings concerning the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. He uses these cases to show how the Court can promote workable government by respecting the roles of other constitutional actors without compromising constitutional principles.<br><i><br>Making Our Democracy Work</i> is a tour de force of history and philosophy, offering an original approach to interpreting the Constitution that judges, lawyers, and scholars will look to for many years to come. And it further establishes Justice Breyer as one of the Court&#x2019;s greatest intellectuals and a leading legal voice of our time.</p><p>Stephen Breyer is an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. He is a resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C.Introduction<br><br>Day after day I see Americans&#x2014;of every race, religion, nationality, and point of view&#x2014;trying to resolve their differences in the courtroom. It has not always been so. In earlier times, both here and abroad, individuals and communities settled their differences not in courtrooms under law but on the streets with violence. We Americans treasure the customs and institutions that have helped us find the better way. And we not only hope but also believe that in the future we will continue to resolve disputes under law, just as surely as we will continue to hold elections for president and Congress. Our beliefs reflect the strength of our Constitution and the institutions it has created.<br><br>The Constitution&#x2019;s form and language have helped it endure. The document is short&#x2014;seven articles and twenty- seven amendments. It focuses primarily on our government&#x2019;s structure. Its provisions form a simple coherent whole, permitting readers without technical knowledge to understand the document and the government it creates. And it traces the government&#x2019;s authority directly to a single source of legitimizing power&#x2014;&#x201c;We the People.&#x201d;<br><br>Words on paper, however, no matter how wise, are not sufficient to preserve a nation. Benjamin Franklin made this point when, in 1787, he told a Philadelphia questioner that the Constitutional Convention had created &#x201c;a republic, Madam, if you can keep it.&#x201d; The separate institutions that the Constitution fashioned&#x2014;Congress, the executive, the judiciary&#x2014;were intended to bring about a form of government that would guarantee that democracy and liberty are not empty promises. But what would enable the Constitution to work not only in theory but also in practice? How could the nation make sure that the Constitution&#x2019;s limits are respected, that our citizens enjoy its important protections, that our legal system resolves disputes fairly and impartially, and that our courts dispense justice?<br><br>Alexander Hamilton, along with many of the other constitutional framers, thought that a Supreme Court would provide part of the<br>answer. The Court would interpret the law, thereby enforcing the Constitution&#x2019;s limits. It would help ensure a democratic political system, and it would safeguard individual constitutional rights and liberties. Indeed, as the historian Gordon Wood has pointed out, &#x201c;by protecting the rights of minorities of all sorts against popular majorities,&#x201d; the Court would &#x201c;become a major instrument for both curbing [American] democracy and maintaining it.&#x201d;<br><br>In the framers&#x2019; eyes, then, the Court would help to maintain the<i> workable democracy</i> that the Constitution sought to create. I have previously written about the Court and democracy, explaining the ways in which that constitutional concept critically affects judicial interpretation of much of the Constitution&#x2019;s language and also how the Constitution&#x2019;s democratic objective assumes a public that actively participates in the nation&#x2019;s political life. The present book focuses on the Supreme Court&#x2019;s role in maintaining a <i>workable </i>constitutional system of government. It discusses how the public and the Court can help make the Constitution work well in practice. And it shows why the Constitution necessarily assumes that the typical American learns something of our nation&#x2019;s history and understands how our government works.<br><br>In particular, this book considers two sets of questions. The first concerns the public&#x2019;s willingness to accept the Court&#x2019;s decisions as<br>legitimate. When the Court interprets the law, will the other branches of government follow those interpretations? Will the public do so? Will they implement even those Court decisions that they believe are wrong and that are highly unpopular? Many of us take for granted that the answer to these questions is yes, but this was not always the case. Part I uses examples from our nation&#x2019;s history to show how, after fragile beginnings, the Court&#x2019;s authority has grown. It describes how the Court was given the power to interpret the Constitution authoritatively, striking down congressional statutes that it finds in conflict with the Constitution. And it goes on to describe several instances where Supreme Court decisions were ignored or disobeyed, where the president&#x2019;s or the public&#x2019;s acceptance of Court decisions was seriously in doubt. These examples of the Court&#x2019;s infirmity&#x2014;perhaps startling today&#x2014;demonstrate that public acceptance is not automatic and cannot be taken for granted. The Court itself must help maintain the public&#x2019;s trust in the Court, the public&#x2019;s confidence in the Constitution, and the public&#x2019;s commitment to the rule of law.<br><br>Part II considers how the Court can carry out this constitutional responsibility. The key lies in the Court&#x2019;s ability to apply the Constitution&#x2019;s enduring values to changing circumstances. In carrying out this basic interpretive task, the Court must thoughtfully employ a set of traditional legal tools in service of a pragmatic approach to interpreting the law. It must understand that its actions have real-world consequences. And it must recognize and respect the roles of other governmental institutions. By taking account of its own experience and expertise as well as those of other institutions, the Court can help make the law work more effectively and thereby better achieve the Constitution&#x2019;s basic objective of creating a workable democratic government. My argument in Part II takes the formof examples drawn fromhistory and from the present day, illustrating the Court&#x2019;s relationships with Congress, the executive branch, the states, other courts, and earlier courts. Part of my aim is to show how the Court can build the necessary productive working relationships with other institutions&#x2014;without abdicating its own role as constitutional guardian.<br><br>The Court&#x2019;s role in protecting individual liberties presents special challenges to these relationships, some of which are discussed in Part III. I describe how this protection often involves a search for permanent values underlying particular constitutional phrases. I describe a method (proportionality) useful in applying those values to complex contemporary circumstances. And I discuss the Japanese internment during World War II as well as the recent Guant�namo cases to illustrate the difficulty of finding a proper balance between liberty and security when a president acts in time of war or special security need.<br><br>Throughout, I argue that the Court should interpret written words, whether in the Constitution or a statute, using traditional legal tools, such as text, history, tradition, precedent, and, particularly, purposes and related consequences, to help make the law effective. In this way, the Court can help maintain the public&#x2019;s confidence in the legitimacy of its interpretive role.<br><br>The various approaches that I discuss in Parts II and III fit together. They constitute a set of pragmatic approaches to interpreting the law. They provide a general perspective of how a pragmatically oriented judge might go about deciding the kinds of cases that make up the work of the Supreme Court. I do not argue that judges should decide all legal cases pragmatically. But I also suggest that by understanding that its actions have real-world consequences and taking those consequences into account, the Court can help make the law work more effectively. It can thereby better achieve the Constitution&#x2019;s basic objective of creating a workable democratic government. In this way the Court can help maintain the public&#x2019;s confidence in the legitimacy of its interpretive role. This point, which returns full circle to Part I, is critical. At the end of the day, the public&#x2019;s confidence is what permits the Court to ensure a Constitution that is more than words on paper. It is what enables the Court to ensure that the Constitution functions democratically, that it protects individual liberty, and that it works in practice for the benefit of all Americans. This book explores ways in which I believe the Court can maintain that confidence and thereby carry out its responsibility to help ensure a Constitution that endures.<br>Chapter Three<br><br><i>The Cherokees</i><br>Although <i>Marbury </i>gave the Court the power to refuse to apply an act of Congress on the ground that it violated the Constitution, the Court did not again exercise that power until its decision in the Dred Scott case more than fifty years later. This hesitancy to find a federal statute unconstitutional, like Marshall&#x2019;s strategic view of Marbury, suggests a Court deeply uncertain as to whether the president, the Congress, or the public itself would accept the Court&#x2019;s views about the Constitution&#x2014;at least when they strongly disagreed with those views. And without assurance that other government officials and the public would follow the law, how could the Court successfully exercise its review power? How could it help to protect, say, an unpopular minority? How could it help make the Constitution more than words on paper?<br><br>Today judges from all over the world ask similar questions. A chief justice of an African nation struggling to maintain an independent judiciary recently asked me directly, &#x201c;Why do Americans do what the courts say?&#x201d; What in the Constitution makes this likely? What is the institutional device that makes court decisions effective? What, she wondered, is the secret? I answered that there is no secret; there are no magic words on paper. Following the law is a matter of custom, of habit, of widely shared understandings as to how those in government and members of the public should, and will, act when faced with a court decision they strongly dislike.<br><br>My short answer to the chief justice&#x2019;s question was to say that history, not legal doctrine, tells us how Americans came to follow the<br>Supreme Court&#x2019;s rulings. My longer answer consists of several examples that illustrate different challenges the Court and the nation faced as gradually, over time, the American public developed those customs and habits.<br><br>The Cherokee Indian cases of the 1830s provide an early example of enforceability put to the test. The Cherokee tribe sued to protect its legal rights to its ancestral lands in northern Georgia. The U.S. Supreme Court held in its favor. What happened next is an unhappy story.<br><br>In the first part of the nineteenth century, a dispute developed between the Cherokee Indians and their neighbors, settlers in the state of Georgia. The dispute was simple. The Indians owned land, rocks, and minerals that the white Georgia settlers wanted, and the Indians did not want to give them up. The Georgians had tried hard for two decades to convince three presidents (James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, and Andrew Jackson) to remove the Indian tribes from Georgia and send them to the West. But they got nowhere. Monroe, for example, told the Georgians that he would use only reasonable, peaceful means to convince the tribe to move.<br><br>The Cherokees, who had lived in northern Georgia far longer than the Georgians, had moved on from their purely hunting/fishing life to become farmers and landowners. They had developed an alphabet, established a printing press, and built a capital called New Echota. Under the leadership of their great chief John Ross, they had also adopted a constitution. They had no reason to leave their own land. And they told President Monroe that &#x201c;it is the fixed and unalterable determination of this nation never again to cede one foot more of our land.&#x201d; They added that they were not foreigners but the original inhabitants of America, who &#x201c;now stand on the soil of their own territory&#x201d; and who will not &#x201c;recognize the sovereignty of any State within the limits of their territory.&#x201d; And they would later tell President Andrew Jackson that when they moved, they would not go west but, instead, would only go &#x201c;by the course of nature to sleep under this ground which the Great Spirit gave our ancestors.&#x201d;<br><br>Then, in 1829, gold was found on the Cherokee lands, and the Georgians decided to break the stalemate. They entered the Cherokee territory and began to work the gold mines. They passed laws that nullified all Cherokee laws, prohibited the Cherokee legislature from meeting, and ordered the arrest of any Cherokee who argued against moving to the West. Furthermore, the Georgians found an ally in a new president, Andrew Jackson, who announced his support for Georgia, refused to keep federal troops in the mining area to enforce the Indians&#x2019; rights, and urged the Indians to move west.<br><br>Some in the federal Congress opposed removing the Indians from their homes, churches, and schools to send them to a &#x201c;wilderness.&#x201d; That minority pointed out that the &#x201c;evil . . . is enormous; the violence is extreme; the breach of public faith deplorable; the inevitable suffering incalculable.&#x201d; But a congressional majority felt differently. And Congress enacted a removal bill that was intended to enforce the president&#x2019;s position.<br><br>Lacking sufficient support in the elected branches of the federal government, where could the Cherokees turn for help? Could they look to the law? After supporting the British during the Revolution, the tribe had signed treaties with the new United States in which the United States promised to protect the Cherokees&#x2019; land and guarantee its boundaries. The Constitution specifically says that not only the Constitution and laws made thereunder but also &#x201c;all Treatiesmade . . . under the Authority of the United States shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the . . . Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.&#x201d;<br><br>Although the Cherokees&#x2019; legal case seemed ironclad, the same political circumstances that led them to put their hopes in the law made it difficult to get that law enforced. The Georgians would not protect them. A majority in Congress apparently did not care. And Andrew Jackson had refused the Indians&#x2019; request to enforce their treaty. Hence, the Cherokees could look only to the courts for protection. <br><br>But the tribe&#x2019;s unpopularity and political weakness made bringing a lawsuit more difficult than one might think. The tribe found a lawyer, William Wirt, a former attorney general of the United States and one of the greatest lawyers of his day. Wirt thought that &#x201c;the Supreme Court would protect&#x201d; the tribe. But Wirt could not be certain that Georgia would follow the law, even if embodied in a Supreme Court decision. After all, some years earlier, when John Quincy Adams was president, the Georgians had seized land belonging to the Creek tribe, passed resolutions declaring they owned it, sent surveyors to map the territory, and said they would &#x201c;resist to the utmost&#x201d; any federal effort, including any Supreme Court effort, to stop them. After all this, the Creeks just<br>gave up.<br><br>Moreover, how was Wirt to get his case to the Supreme Court? He hesitated to bring a case in Georgia&#x2019;s own courts&#x2014;for example, by suing Georgians for trespass. He feared that Georgia state judges might indefinitely delay matters by raising problems of state property law. He thought for a time that he might represent a Cherokee Indian&#x2014;Corn Tassel&#x2014;whom the Georgians had arrested for committing a serious crime in Cherokee territory. Wirt would appeal Corn Tassel&#x2019;s case to the Supreme Court, arguing that Georgia did not have the power to enforce its laws in the Cherokees&#x2019; territory. But Georgia&#x2019;s governor and legislature announced that they would pay no attention to the Court&#x2019;s decision and would resist with force any effort to enforce a Supreme Court order. To make certain a Court order would have no effect, Georgia executed Corn Tassel before the Supreme Court could hear the case.<br><br>Wirt next tried suing Georgia directly in the Supreme Court, in the case of <i>Cherokee Nation v.

With drum 'n' bass pounding the backstreets, Saul must confront the forces that would use him, the forces that would destroy him, and the forces that shape his own bizarre identity.</p><p>China Mieville's <i>King Rat</i> was nominated for both the International Horror Guild and Bram Stoker Awards for best first novel.</p></p><p>Saul Garamond returns from a journey in late evening and sneaks into his bedroom to avoid a confrontation with his estranged father. He awakes to the intrusion of police and the news that his father has been murdered and he is the number-one suspect. Forgotten in a jail cell, he is freed by a peculiar, stinking, and impossibly strong stranger--only to find rescue may be worse than imprisonment. The plot moves through subterranean and rooftop London quick as a techno beat, as Saul discovers his curious heritage and finds himself marked for death in an age-old secret war among frightful inhuman powers.<p> China Mi�ville's urban fantasy novel, <i>King Rat</i>, is an impressive, even daring, debut. It is a Lost Prince story that avoids both black-and-white morality and the standard fantasy-novel adoration of royalty. Furthermore, it is inspired by the unlikeliest of sources, the Rat King legend and the Pied Piper of Hamelin fairy tale. Finally, <i>King Rat</i>, powered and propelled by the rhythms of jungle/drum-'n'-bass music, is a fantasy novel set in the 1990s that genuinely captures the 1990s. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>"This is a riveting, brilliant novel. The language sings, the concepts are original and engrossing." --Charles de Lint<p> "A genuine contribution to London's subterranean mythology. <i>King Rat</i> is as sharp as a Tokyo comic. It's humane and delinquent. And it bites." --Iain Sinclair</p><p> "[Mieville's] prose melds James Herbert's nihilistic violence with the metropolitan paranoia of Martin Amis, circa London Fields, and he shows a talent for authentic dialog and cinematic set pieces. Most striking, perhaps, is the meticulously crafted topography of a brooding London peopled by despondent youth and bizarre night creatures and rife with the rhythms of drum 'n' bass." --<i>The Times</i> (London)</p><p> "<i>King Rat</i>: a story so compelling you almost haven't time to notice how fine the writing is; a dark myth reinvented for our time and for London in particular with great wit, style, and imagination." --Ramsey Campbell</p><p> "[An] extraordinary debut novel. . . .

Studies show that we can go only three minutes without air, perhaps three days without water, maybe three weeks without food. . . and but three hours without offering somebody our suggestions, responses, or critiques. A perennial &#34;hot&#34; topic in management circles is the process of giving, getting and analyzing advice. This brief and engaging book can be of use to anyone who has to interact with other people. You&#39;ll enjoy the &#34;read&#34; so much that you may not realize how much you have gained - all in words of one syllable! How to offer feedback when asked (or hired) to do so. Why feedback tells more about the giver than the receiver. How feedback is distorted or resisted by the receiver&#39;s point of view and defense mechanisms.

It was the last anyone ever saw of him. After Perry Hollow Police Chief Jim Campbell found Charlie&#x2019;s bike caught in the water above Sunset Falls, he assumed the worst. Everyone did&#x2014;except Charlie&#x2019;s mother.<br><br>Years later, Eric Olmstead&#x2014;now a famous author and Charlie&#x2019;s younger brother&#x2014;has come back to Perry Hollow to bury his mother and fulfill her last request: Find Charlie. To do so, he goes to the current police chief, his former sweetheart, Kat Campbell, who happens to be Jim Campbell&#x2019;s daughter. Together they soon discover that Eric&#x2019;s mother was convinced Charlie was kidnapped, and that finding him&#x2014;whether he was dead or alive&#x2014;was her secret obsession. While she never succeeded, she did uncover clues that suggested he wasn&#x2019;t the only boy across Pennsylvania to vanish into thin air during that time.<br><br>The haunting story of a boy missing for forty years, and of a small town that found lies easier to believe than the truth, explodes into the present in <i>Bad Moon</i>, Todd Ritter&#x2019;s excellent follow-up to his acclaimed debut.</p></p><p><p>TODD RITTER, author of Death Notice,&nbsp;is a career journalist and is currently at <i>The Star-Ledger</i>. He lives in suburban New Jersey. <i>Bad Moon</i> is his second novel.</p>ONE<br><br>Five minutes.<br><br>That&#x2019;s how much time Kat Campbell had until she needed to be out the door. Five lousy minutes to brew coffee, feed the dog, pack her son&#x2019;s lunch, and toast two bagels for them to eat in the car. On a good morning, all of that could be accomplished in ten minutes. But this wasn&#x2019;t a good morning. Not by a long shot.<br><br>The coffee was brewing so slowly it made Kat wish someone would just hurry up and invent a caffeine IV drip. One bagel was trapped in the toaster, quickly turning from golden brown to charcoal black. The other sat on the kitchen counter, waiting to meet the same fate. James&#x2019;s lunch so far consisted of two slices of bread and a cup of chocolate pudding. His beagle, Scooby, had already given up on the prospect of breakfast and was now chewing an empty toilet paper roll dug out of the bathroom trash.<br><br>&#x201c;James? Are you almost ready?&#x201d;<br><br>Kat didn&#x2019;t move from the kitchen counter. She was well aware how far lung power traveled in her house, and her voice would have no trouble rushing up the stairs and into her son&#x2019;s bedroom.<br><br>&#x201c;In a minute,&#x201d; James called back. It was punctuated by the sound of a dresser drawer slamming shut.<br><br>Never a good sign.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the first day of school. We don&#x2019;t have a minute.&#x201d;<br><br>In reality, they had three, but Kat was too busy making his lunch to correct herself. She slapped some cold cuts on the bread, coated it with mustard, and dropped it into a Ziploc bag. This was tossed into James&#x2019;s lunchbox with the pudding, a granola bar, and milk money. Then it was on to the bagels. The one stuck in the toaster was freed with some shaking, tapping, and the strategic use of a butter knife. The untoasted one remained that way.<br><br>Next came Scooby, who had dropped the toilet paper roll into his dinner bowl, presumably to make Kat feel just a bit more neglectful. She replaced it with kibble, refilled his water dish, and let him go to town.<br>By that time, the coffeemaker was squeezing out a few last drops. Kat grabbed the pot and poured half of it into a thermos. She was done, with a minute to spare.<br><br>Pausing to catch her breath, she turned to the small television sitting on the kitchen counter. James sometimes watched cartoons on it while eating breakfast on Saturday mornings. That day, it was turned to CNN, where a blandly handsome anchor was sharing breaking news.<br><br>&#x201c;The space race has officially restarted,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Early today, the China National Space Administration successfully launched its first manned voyage to the moon.&#x201d;<br><br>The screen switched from the anchor to a clip of China&#x2019;s president hailing the launch. That was followed by footage of the launch itself&#x2014;a distant shot of an ivory tower streaking across the sky. After that was a view of Tiananmen Square, where thousands of spectators cheered.<br><br>&#x201c;As the entire nation watched, three Chinese astronauts took off for the moon. They are expected to reach it Friday afternoon. A successful mission would make China only the second country, after the United States, to send a man to the moon. It would also be the first time since 1972 that man has set foot on the moon&#x2019;s surface.&#x201d;<br><br>Kat checked her watch. Time was up. Switching off the TV, she called upstairs once more. &#x201c;James, we&#x2019;ve got to go. Even if you&#x2019;re still naked, we&#x2019;re leaving this house.&#x201d;<br><br>Two seconds later, her son stomped into the kitchen wearing jeans, a Phillies T-shirt, and sneakers. The clothes and shoes were new. And expensive. At first, Kat had balked at spending so much on back-to-school clothes, but James swore up and down that he needed them to fit in. Kat realized, sadly, it was most likely true. James was entering fifth grade, a tough year for any kid, let alone one with Down syndrome. But he was a smart boy, able to keep up with the others in his class, and so far he had made it through elementary school with a minimum of teasing. In order to keep it that way, Kat was willing to shell out for new clothes. And sneakers. And a backpack, even though the one James had used last year was in perfectly good condition.<br><br>The only holdover was his lunch box, which featured characters from the movie <i>Cars</i>. Kat had assumed James would want a newer, cooler one, just like everything else. But when he didn&#x2019;t mention it, she didn&#x2019;t bring it up. She was all too happy to save a few bucks and pack his lunch inside good old Lightning McQueen.<br><br>Yet when Kat handed him the lunch box, James looked at her like she had just grown a second head.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your lunch. Or at least something that resembles lunch.&#x201d;<br><br>James wasn&#x2019;t amused. &#x201c;Fifth graders don&#x2019;t use lunch boxes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t get that memo. And we don&#x2019;t have time to deal with it now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;ll look stupid,&#x201d; James protested as he slung his backpack over his shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t look stupid last year.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But that was fourth grade. It was cool in fourth grade.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;ll be cool tomorrow.&#x201d; Kat handed him his bagel and nudged him toward the back door. &#x201c;But today it&#x2019;s either the lunch box or no lunch at all.&#x201d;<br><br>James sighed dramatically. It had become his usual way of demonstrating that he was right and she was wrong. Whenever she heard it, Kat felt a twinge of nostalgia for the boy who used to think everything she did was wonderful.<br><br>Once James was out the door, she reached for a small rack on the wall behind it. One hook contained the keys to her patrol car. The other held her holster. Kat removed both, putting the keys in her pocket and the holster around her waist. Below the rack was a small safe that contained her Glock. She opened it, removed the gun, and checked the safety before quickly sliding it into her holster. Then she grabbed her own bagel and thermos and left the house.<br><br>Although James didn&#x2019;t bring up the lunch box again during the drive to school, he was certainly thinking about it. He spent the entire trip staring at it with resignation and, Kat sensed, no small amount of trepidation. He was nervous, which was understandable. Kat was nervous, too. She remembered entering the fifth grade and discovering how different it was from the previous year. It was the same way with sixth grade. And then junior high, which was a whole other world of cliques, peer pressure, and petty cruelties.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be fine, Little Bear,&#x201d; she said as they approached the school. &#x201c;And we&#x2019;ll brown-bag your lunch tomorrow.&#x201d;<br><br>James&#x2019;s nervous gaze moved from the lunch box to Kat. &#x201c;Promise?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I promise.&#x201d;<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>After sending James off with a peck on the cheek that he quickly wiped away, Kat headed to work. Perry Hollow&#x2019;s police station sat a few blocks southeast of the school, but instead of taking a shortcut to get there, she turned onto Main Street and drove its entire length. Taking her time, she scanned the quaint shops and restaurants that lined both sides of the thoroughfare.<br><br>They were the heart of Perry Hollow now that the lumber mill that had given the town its name was gone. Part of her job as police chief was to make sure that heart was beating strongly. If Big Joe&#x2019;s, the town&#x2019;s de facto Starbucks, was closed, it meant something was wrong with its aged proprietor, Ellen Faye, and that Kat needed to check up on her. When passing Awesome Blossoms, the flower shop, she made a point to note the presence of its delivery van, which had been stolen in the past.<br><br>It was still too early for most of the businesses to be open, but the lights were on at Big Joe&#x2019;s, which meant Ellen was still chugging along. The same was true at the Perry Hollow Diner, where pickup trucks outnumbered cars in the parking lot by a three-to-one margin. And sitting in front of Awesome Blossoms was a white Ford delivery van.<br><br>The sight made Kat sigh with relief, considering the hell the town went through when it was stolen.<br><br>Almost a year had passed since the end of those dark days, and Perry Hollow seemed to have gotten over the worst of it.<br><br>For the most part, Kat and James had, too.<br><br>Once she finished the inspection of Main Street, Kat maneuvered the Crown Vic down a side street and into the police station&#x2019;s parking lot. Two other cars were already there. One was a patrol car similar to her own. That was driven by her deputy, Carl Bauersox, who was finishing up his usual night shift. The other was a Volkswagen Beetle that belonged to Louella van Sickle, the station&#x2019;s dispatcher, secretary, cleaning lady, and all-around indispensable presence.<br><br>When Kat entered the station, Lou was already at her desk. She eyed the thermos and blackened bagel in Kat&#x2019;s hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Stuck in the toaster again?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yup,&#x201d; Kat said. &#x201c;It was one of those mornings. I predict the coffee sucks, too.&#x201d;<br><br>She took a sip, proving herself right. The coffee was far too strong, with a bitter aftertaste that stuck in the back of her throat.<br><br>Lou shook her gray-haired head. &#x201c;Bad coffee. Burned bagels. You need a man in that house.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you,&#x201d; Kat said, &#x201c;need to get your mind out of the fifties.&#x201d;<br><br>Lou, who had been married for forty-three years, took it as a compliment.<br><br>&#x201c;Call me old-fashioned, but I like not having to worry about making the coffee in the morning. Al does that. And he fixes the toilet. And mows the lawn. Plus, he&#x2019;s still pretty good in the bed department.&#x201d;<br>Kat didn&#x2019;t need to know that. Nor did she need a man, despite Lou&#x2019;s insistence otherwise. She had enough on her plate already&#x2014;job, son, dog. There wasn&#x2019;t any room on her schedule for finding and keeping a mate.<br>&#x201c;All I&#x2019;m saying is keep an open mind,&#x201d; Lou told her. &#x201c;One of these days, the perfect man could walk through that door and you&#x2019;d dismiss him immediately.&#x201d;<br><br>At that moment, a man did walk through the door. But Carl Bauersox, who was nice enough, wasn&#x2019;t Kat&#x2019;s type. Plus, he was married, with two kids and another on the way.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you make coffee?&#x201d; Lou asked him.<br><br>Carl answered with a nod. &#x201c;And I fix the toilet and mow the lawn.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So you heard our conversation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Carl said, his baby face growing red. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t want to talk about the bed stuff.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; Lou said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call your wife and ask her.&#x201d;<br><br>The deputy looked mortified, as if she&#x2019;d actually do it. Lou didn&#x2019;t help matters by reaching for the phone. Kat beat her to it, pressing palm to receiver and assuring Carl that no calls would be made to his wife about their sex life. Ever.<br><br>&#x201c;How was your shift?&#x201d; she asked him. &#x201c;Anything to report?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not really. Speeding ticket on Old Mill Road. The Wellington kid again.&#x201d;<br><br>Kat arched an eyebrow. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s his third ticket in four months, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yup,&#x201d; Carl said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait until they suspend his license so I can take a break from writing the darn things.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And nothing else suspicious?&#x201d; Kat asked. &#x201c;Nothing at all?&#x201d;<br><br>She knew she was being paranoid. If something had been amiss during the night, Carl would have told her about it. But she needed to be thorough, especially after the events of the previous year. Once a town goes through the experience of having a serial killer on the loose, it&#x2019;s hard to return to the way things were.<br><br>Carl laid a hand on her shoulder. &#x201c;Relax, Chief, everything is fine. Now I&#x2019;m going to go home and give my wife something to brag to Lou about.&#x201d;<br><br>His uncharacteristic stab at bawdy humor made Kat laugh out loud. Lou did her one better: she catcalled at him. Blushing even more than before, Carl waved weakly and left the station.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m talking about,&#x201d; Lou said. &#x201c;You need a Carl.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What I need is a toaster oven and a gift certificate to Big Joe&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>Kat grabbed her bitter coffee and burned bagel and headed to her office. She took two steps before being stopped by another man entering the station.<br><br>&#x201c;Chief Campbell. Just who I wanted to see.&#x201d;<br><br>Once again, it wasn&#x2019;t Prince Charming. In fact, Burt Hammond, the town&#x2019;s mayor, was the complete opposite of charming. He was tall, slightly over six feet, and as fit as someone in his early sixties could be. Yet an aura of sleaze always seemed to surround him. Maybe it was his too-white smile. Or the spray-on tan that made him the same shade as a glazed ham. Or the fact that he was a lawn mower salesman who just happened to be holding a half-price sale on election day. He won by a landslide.<br>Kat didn&#x2019;t have to deal with him very much, which was good, because she didn&#x2019;t like him very much, either. She had learned through the grapevine&#x2014;in which Lou van Sickle was the head grape&#x2014;that Mayor Hammond felt the same about her. On the occasions when they were forced to meet, their conversations were terse but cordial.<br><br>Widening his lips into that fake grin that seemed to afflict all politicians, Burt said, &#x201c;Sorry for the intrusion, but I was wondering if I could have a word in private.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure thing.&#x201d; Kat led him to her office and settled behind her desk. &#x201c;What can I do for you, Burt?&#x201d;<br><br>The mayor remained standing, hands behind his back, head bowed ever-so-slightly. From her seat, Kat had a dead-on view of the prominent mole on his chin. Burt had been known for the mole long before he was known as the mayor. Roughly the size of a dime, it wasn&#x2019;t unsightly, nor was it particularly dark. It was just so large that, once you spotted it, you couldn&#x2019;t stop looking at it. Plus, it made Burt instantly recognizable, a fact he capitalized on in ad campaigns for his lawn mower dealership. There was even talk that the real mole had been removed years ago and that Burt now sported a fake one just so he&#x2019;d still be recognized.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been doing some number crunching,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Just trying to see where we stand before digging in and starting the budget for next year. You know the drill.&#x201d;<br><br>Kat was well acquainted with submitting requests for more staff, better equipment, new patrol cars. Every year, all but the smallest requests were turned down on the excuse that money was tight across the board and that every department had to share the burden. So while she and Carl got to drink from a new watercooler, their eight-year-old Crown Vics would have to spend another twelve months on the road.<br><br>&#x201c;This year,&#x201d; Burt continued, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re asking for new patrol cars.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;New Dodge Chargers,&#x201d; Kat added.<br><br>Top-of-the-line ones at that. The department in Mercerville, the next town over, got some two years ago. They were sleek and safe and fast as hell, an asset Kat never really thought was necessary until the events of last year.<br><br>&#x201c;Unfortunately,&#x201d; Burt said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re not getting them. There&#x2019;s just not enough money in the budget. Nor is there any money for a new hire, even though you&#x2019;ve made it abundantly clear that you want another officer in the ranks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I <i>need</i> another officer.&#x201d;<br><br>Burt never stopped smiling. Kat had seen more sincere grins on corpses, and she wanted to wipe it off Burt&#x2019;s face with the back of her hand.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just doing my job,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;m doing mine. Which is looking out for my department.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t just about your department. We&#x2019;re all making sacrifices here.&#x201d;<br><br>The word made Kat roll her eyes. &#x201c;Sacrifices? Talk to the families of the people who died last year.

And because they often live near people&#x2014;in our gardens, parks, and cities&#x2014;they are also keenly aware of our peculiarities, staying away from and even scolding anyone who threatens or harms them and quickly learning to recognize and approach those who care for and feed them, even giving them numerous, oddly touching gifts in return. <br><br>With his extraordinary research on the intelligence and startling abilities of corvids&#x2014;crows, ravens, and jays&#x2014;scientist John Marzluff teams up with artist-naturalist Tony Angell to tell amazing stories of these brilliant birds in <i>Gifts of the Crow. </i>With narrative, diagrams, and gorgeous line drawings, they offer an in-depth look at these complex creatures and our shared behaviors. The ongoing connection between humans and crows&#x2014;a cultural coevolution&#x2014;has shaped both species for millions of years. And the characteristics of crows that allow this symbiotic relationship are language, delinquency, frolic, passion, wrath, risk-taking, and awareness&#x2014;seven traits that humans find strangely familiar. Crows gather around their dead, warn of impending doom, recognize people, commit murder of other crows, lure fish and birds to their death, swill coffee, drink beer, turn on lights to stay warm, design and use tools, use cars as nutcrackers, windsurf and sled to play, and work in tandem to spray soft cheese out of a can. Their marvelous brains allow them to think, plan, and reconsider their actions. <br><br>With its abundance of funny, awe-inspiring, and poignant stories, <i>Gifts of the Crow </i>portrays creatures who are nothing short of amazing. A testament to years of painstaking research and careful observation, this fully illustrated, riveting work is a thrilling look at one of nature&#x2019;s most wondrous creatures.</p><p><b>John Marzluff, Ph.D.,</b> is Professor of Wildlife Science at the University of Washington. The author of four books and over one hundred scientific papers on various aspects of bird behavior, he is the recipient of the A. Brazier Howell, Board of Directors, and H.R. Painton awards from the Cooper Ornithological Society. <br><b>Tony Angell</b> has authored and/or illustrated a dozen award-winning books related to natural history.<b>Preface</b><br><br>A BLUE-BLACK CROW PERCHES REGALLY on the cornice of a stone building on the University of Washington campus, where he is often found. Almost hourly, he delivers food to his mate and three fledglings, while also keeping watch for any threat to the nest. Suddenly he turns his head, caws softly, and glides away, landing on a lamppost directly above a blonde woman. The woman, Lijana Holmes, smiles and calls him &#x201c;Bela&#x201d; as she offers him a breakfast of eggs and meat, which she prepares daily. Bela, in turn, presents his special gift&#x2014;recognizing Lijana and participating in this routine with her. His gift to Lijana is more abstract than what he provides his bird family, but it is powerful nonetheless&#x2014;it is the ephemeral and profound connection to nature that many people crave.<br> <br>Bela gives a slightly different gift this morning to my team as we walk through the same campus. For Bela knows us, and we know him. Five-and-a-half years ago we captured Bela and affixed light plastic rings to his legs for identification. So whenever he sees us, the old crow cocks his head, stares, takes flight and swoops low&#x2014;right at us&#x2014;screaming a harsh call that we immediately recognize as a bird scold. His family and neighbors hear the cry and join in, flying toward Bela to support his attack, and soon they, too, share his rage. The mobbing crows circle and scream above our heads just as they would do to a predator. Bela&#x2019;s discriminating actions give us remarkable and invaluable information, proving that crows can recognize and remember human faces. We wonder when, or if, he will ever forget (or forgive) us.<br> <br>The gifts of the crow are physical, metaphorical, and far-reaching. Some, like Bela, provide understanding and companionship. Others have delivered sparkling glass, plastic toys, and candy hearts to their human benefactors. Some have dropped from the sky and shocked strangers by saying, &#x201c;Hello.&#x201d; A raven, with its natural curiosity and conspicuous manner, can lead a hunter to game or alert a search party to the whereabouts of an injured person. A magpie or jay can brighten a cold day by pecking softly at a window to beg for its daily ration of food.<br> <br>These birds are corvids, members of the avian family Corvidae, which includes nutcrackers, jays, ravens, magpies, and crows. We will consider many of the gifts with which corvids enrich the lives of people and the action of nature in the chapters ahead, and we will argue that a corvid&#x2019;s ability to quickly and accurately infer causation is itself a natural gift. It has survival value. This and other demonstrations of its mental prowess are gifts that all birds&#x2014;and most likely their dinosaur ancestors&#x2014;gained through evolution.<br> <br>Crows&#x2019; close association with humans has inspired art, language, legends, and myths. Corvids have their own form of eloquence as they exercise mischief, playfulness, and passion. They also lead us to reflect on their common behaviors with us and other sentient creatures and empower us with a deeper understanding of nature.<br> <br>People from all walks of life eagerly recount the antics of their former pet crows or enthusiastically tell us authors about the fascinating, sometimes troubling behaviors perpetrated by their local jays, magpies, and ravens. In this book we celebrate their accounts along with others we have found in the scientific and popular literature, because these rare and exceptional behaviors cannot be limited to the few specialized researchers who study corvids.<br> <br>Some scientists are dismissive of citizens&#x2019; reports, viewing them as unreliable or unexplainable, because of laypeople&#x2019;s lack of formal training, lack of documentation, overinterpretation, and uncontrolled influences. To be sure, we have encountered descriptions of events laden with hyperbole and seasoned with more imagination than fact, but we were compelled to investigate them nonetheless and to interview the people who made the observations in order to verify the events. Taken individually, such stories are anecdotal, but collectively they provide a unique body of information that stimulates scientific exploration and becomes an assemblage of possibilities.<br> <br>We draw from this cross-cultural collection to offer many intriguing stories about corvids&#x2019; fascinating behaviors as we explore the anatomy and physiology of the bird brain. We have tested these anecdotes, such as those of the crow that summoned dogs or the ravens that windsurfed. Putting them through the scientific process, we evaluated each report for believability, precedence in the scientific and cultural literature, and the mental ability a bird would need to act in such a manner. We came to know the bird and the citizen scientist behind the observation as we examined as completely as possible what causes people and birds to share such poignant moments.<br> <br>We recognize the intelligence and adaptability of this unique group of birds and base every thesis about their humanlike behaviors on how the brain of a bird is known to function. Through brain-scanning technology, which allows us to see within the crow&#x2019;s gray matter, we first glimpse how a crow&#x2019;s brain works through a problem. To date, most of the understanding of the inner working of the crow brain was derived from what was known from a few mammals and detailed investigations of song-learning in birds. We hope you will find, as we have, that understanding some of the neurobiological processes of crows adds mightily to your appreciation of how these remarkable creatures operate so successfully in our dynamic world.</p><h2>Student Workbook (America the Beautiful)</h2><p>A workbook of crosswords, find-a-words, matching, codes, drawing assignments, and other handwork activities which review and reinforce information learned in the daily lessons.

STEELE<br><br>The most dangerous man on Mars was Omar al-�Baz, and the first time I saw him, he was throwing up at the Rio Zephyria spaceport.<br><br>This happens more frequently than you might think. People coming here for the first time often don&#x2019;t realize just how thin the air really is. The cold surprises them, too, but I&#x2019;m told the atmospheric pressure is about the same as you&#x2019;d find in the Himalayas. So they come trooping down the ramp of the shuttle that transported them from Deimos Station, and if the ride down didn&#x2019;t make them puke, then the shortness of breath, headaches, and nausea that comes with altitude sickness will.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t know for sure that the middle-�aged gent who&#x2019;d doubled over and vomited was Dr. al-�Baz, but I suspected that he was; I hadn&#x2019;t seen any other Middle Eastern men on his flight. There was nothing I could do for him, though, so I waited patiently on the other side of the chain-�link security fence while one of the flight attendants came down the ramp to help him. Dr. al-�Baz waved her away; he didn&#x2019;t need any assistance, thank you. He straightened up, pulled a handkerchief from his overcoat pocket, and wiped his mouth, then picked up the handle of the rolling bag he&#x2019;d dropped when his stomach revolted. Nice to know that he wasn&#x2019;t entirely helpless.<br><br>He was one of the last passengers to step through the gate. He paused on the other side of the fence, looked around, and spotted the cardboard sign I was holding. A brief smile of relief, then he walked over to me.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Omar al-�Baz,&#x201d; he said, holding out his hand. &#x201c;You must be Mr. Ramsey.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m your guide. Call me Jim.&#x201d; Not wanting to shake a hand that just wiped a mouth, which had just spilled yuck all over nice clean concrete, I reached forward to relieve him of his bag.<br><br>&#x201c;I can carry this myself, thank you,&#x201d; he said, not letting me take his bag from him. &#x201c;But if you could help me with the rest of my luggage, I&#x2019;d appreciate it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure. No problem.&#x201d; He hadn&#x2019;t hired me to be his porter, and if he&#x2019;d been the jerk variety of tourist some of my former clients had been, I would&#x2019;ve made him carry his own stuff. But I was already beginning to like the guy: early fifties, skinny but with the beginnings of a potbelly, coarse black hair going grey at the temples. He wore round spectacles and had a bushy mustache beneath a hooked, aquiline nose, and looked a little like an Arab Groucho Marx. Omar al-�Baz couldn&#x2019;t have been anything but what he was, an Egyptian-�American professor from the University of Arizona.<br><br>I led him toward the terminal, stepping around the tourists and business travelers who had also disembarked from the 3 p.m. shuttle. &#x201c;Are you by yourself, or did someone come with you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Unfortunately, I come alone. The university provided grant money sufficient for only one fare, even though I requested that I bring a grad student as an assistant.&#x201d; He frowned. &#x201c;This may hinder my work, but I hope that what I intend to do will be simple enough that I may accomplish it on my own.&#x201d;<br><br>I had only the vaguest idea of why he&#x2019;d hired me to be his guide, but the noise and bustle of the terminal were too much for a conversation. Passenger bags were beginning to come down the conveyor belt, but Dr. al-�Baz didn&#x2019;t join the crowd waiting to pick up suitcases and duffel bags. Instead, he went straight to the PanMars cargo window, where he presented a handful of receipts to the clerk. I began to regret my offer to help carry his bags when a cart was pushed through a side door. Stacked upon it were a half dozen aluminum cases; even in Martian gravity, none small enough to be carried two at a time.<br><br>&#x201c;You gotta be kidding,&#x201d; I murmured.<br><br>&#x201c;My apologies, but for the work I need to do, I had to bring specialized equipment.&#x201d; He signed a form, then turned to me again. &#x201c;Now . . . do you have a means of taking all this to my hotel, or will I have to get a cab?&#x201d;<br><br>I looked over the stack of cases and decided that there weren&#x2019;t so many that I couldn&#x2019;t fit them all in the back of my jeep. So we pushed the cart out to where I&#x2019;d parked beside the front entrance and managed to get everything tied down with elastic cords I carried with me. Dr. al-�Baz climbed into the passenger seat and put his suitcase on the floor between his feet.<br><br>&#x201c;Hotel first?&#x201d; I asked as I took my place behind the wheel.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, please . . . and then I wouldn&#x2019;t mind getting a drink.&#x201d; He caught the questioning look in my eye and gave me a knowing smile. &#x201c;No, I am not a devout follower of the Prophet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Glad to hear it.&#x201d; I was liking him better all the time; I don&#x2019;t trust people who won&#x2019;t have a beer with me. I started up the jeep and pulled away from the curb. &#x201c;So . . . you said in your e-�mail you&#x2019;d like to visit an aboriginal settlement. Is that still what you want to do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I do.&#x201d; He hesitated. &#x201c;But now that we&#x2019;ve met, I think it&#x2019;s only fair to tell you that this is not all that I mean to do. The trip here involves more than just meeting the natives.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How so? What else do you want?&#x201d;<br><br>He peered at me over the top of his glasses. &#x201c;The blood of a Martian.&#x201d;<br><br>When I was a kid, one of my favorite movies was The War of the Worlds&#x2014;�the 1953 version, made about twelve years before the first probes went to Mars. Even back then, people knew that Mars had an Earth-�like environment; spectroscopes had revealed the presence of an oxygen-�nitrogen atmosphere, and strong telescopes made visible the seas and canals. But no one knew for sure whether the planet was inhabited until Ares I landed there in 1977, so George Pal had a lot of latitude when he and his film crew tried to imagine what a Martian would look like.<br><br>Anyway, there&#x2019;s a scene in the movie where Gene Barry and Ann Robinson have made their way to L.A. after escaping the collapsed farmhouse where they&#x2019;d been pinned down by the alien invaders. Barry meets with his fellow scientists at the Pacific Tech and pre�sents them with a ruined camera-�eye he managed to grab while fighting off the attackers. The camera-�eye is wrapped in Ann Robinson&#x2019;s scarf, which was splattered with gore when Gene clobbered a little green monster with a broken pipe.<br><br>&#x201c;And this&#x201d;&#x2014;he says melodramatically, showing the scarf to the other scientists&#x2014;&#x201c;blood of a Martian!&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;ve always loved that part. So when Dr. al-�Baz said much the same thing, I wondered if he was being clever, copping a line from a classic movie that he figured most colonists might have seen. But there was no wink, no ironic smile. So far as I could tell, he was as serious as he could be.<br><br>I decided to let it wait until we had that drink together, so I held my tongue as I drove him into Rio Zephyria. The professor&#x2019;s reservation was at the John Carter Casino Resort, located on the strip near the Mare Cimmerium beach. No surprise there: It&#x2019;s the most famous hotel in Rio, so most tourists try to book rooms there. Edgar Rice Burroughs was having a literary renaissance around the time it was built, so someone decided that A Princess of Mars and its sequels would be a great theme for a casino. Since then it&#x2019;s become the place most people think of when they daydream about taking a vacation trip to Mars.<br><br>Good for them, but I want to throw a rock through its gold-�tinted windows every time I drive by. It&#x2019;s a ten-�story monument to every stupid thing humans have done since coming here. And if I feel that way, as someone who was born and raised on Mars, then you can well imagine what the shatan think of it . . . when they come close enough to see it, that is.<br><br>It was hard to gauge Dr. al-�Baz&#x2019;s reaction when we pulled up in front of the hotel lobby. I was beginning to learn that his normal expression was stoical. But as a bellhop was unloading his stuff and putting it on a cart, the professor spotted the casino entrance. The doorman was dark-�skinned and a little more than two meters in height; he wore the burnoose robes of an aborigine, with a saber in the scabbard on his belt.<br><br>Dr. al-�Baz stared at him. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not a Martian, is he?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not unless he used to play center for the Blue Devils.&#x201d; Dr. al-�Baz raised an eyebrow, and I smiled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Tito Jones, star of the Duke basketball team . . . or at least until he came here.&#x201d; I shook my head. &#x201c;Poor guy. He didn&#x2019;t know why the casino hired him to be their celebrity greeter until they put him in that outfit.&#x201d;<br><br>Dr. al-�Baz had already lost interest. &#x201c;I was hoping he might be a Martian,&#x201d; he said softly. &#x201c;It would have made things easier.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They wouldn&#x2019;t be caught dead here . . . or anywhere near the colonies, for that matter.&#x201d; I turned to follow the bellhop through the revolving door. &#x201c;And by the way . . . we don&#x2019;t call them &#x2018;Martians.&#x2019; &#x2018;Aborigines&#x2019; is the preferred term.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll keep that in mind. And what do the Mar . . . the aborigines call themselves?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They call themselves shatan . . . which means &#x2018;people&#x2019; in their language.&#x201d; Before he could ask the obvious next question, I added, &#x201c;Their word for us is nashatan, or &#x2018;not-�people,&#x2019; but that&#x2019;s only when they&#x2019;re being polite. They call us a lot of things, most of them pretty nasty.&#x201d;<br><br>The professor nodded and was quiet for a little while.<br><br>The University of Arizona might not have sprung for a grad student&#x2019;s marsliner ticket, but they made up for it by reserving a two-�room suite. After the bellhop unloaded his cart and left, Dr. al-�Baz explained that he&#x2019;d need the main room&#x2014;�a large parlor complete with a bar&#x2014;�for the temporary lab he intended to set up. He didn&#x2019;t unpack right away, though; he was ready for that drink I&#x2019;d promised him. So we left everything in the room and caught the elevator back downstairs.<br><br>The hotel bar is located in the casino, but I didn&#x2019;t want to drink in a place where the bartender is decked out like a Barsoomian warlord and the waitresses are dolled up as princesses of Helium. The John Carter is the only place on Mars where anyone looks like that; no one in their right mind would wear so few clothes outside, not even in the middle of summer. So we returned to the jeep and I got away from the strip, heading into the old part of town that the tourists seldom visit.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a good watering hole about three blocks from my apartment. It was still late afternoon, so the place wasn&#x2019;t crowded yet. The bar was quiet and dark, perfect for conversation. The owner knew me; he brought over a pitcher of ale as soon as the professor and I sat down at a table in the back.<br><br>&#x201c;Take it easy with this,&#x201d; I told Dr. al-�Baz as I poured beer into a tallneck and pushed it across the table to him. &#x201c;Until you get acclimated, it might hit you pretty hard.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take your advice.&#x201d; The professor took a tentative sip and smiled. &#x201c;Good. Better than I was expecting, in fact. Local?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hellas City Amber. You think we&#x2019;d have beer shipped all the way from Earth?&#x201d; There were more important things we needed to discuss, so I changed the subject. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this about wanting blood? When you got in touch with me, all you said was that you wanted me to take you to an aboriginal settlement.&#x201d;<br><br>Dr. al-�Baz didn&#x2019;t say anything for a moment or so. He toyed with the stem of his glass, rolling it back and forth between his fingers. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;d told you the entire truth,&#x201d; he finally admitted, &#x201c;I was afraid you might not agree to take me. And you come very highly recommended. As I understand, you&#x2019;re not only native-�born, but your parents were among the first settlers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised you know that. You must have talked to a former client.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you remember Ian Horner? Anthropologist from Cambridge University?&#x201d; I did indeed, although not kindly; Dr. Horner had hired me to be his guide, but if you&#x2019;d believed everything he said, he knew more about Mars than I did. I nodded, keeping my opinion to myself. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a friend of mine,&#x201d; Dr. al-�Baz continued, &#x201c;or at least someone with whom I&#x2019;ve been in contact on a professional basis.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re another anthropologist.&#x201d;</p><h2>Look at Me</h2><p>In her first novel since her widely praised debut, <i>The Invisible Circus</i>, Jennifer Egan demonstrates once again her virtuosity at weaving a spellbinding story with language that dazzles. In this boldly ambitious and symphonic novel, she captures the tenor of our times and offers an unsettling glimpse of the future.<br><br>Fashion model Charlotte Swenson returns to Manhattan, having just recovered from a catastrophic car accident in her hometown of Rockford, Illinois. The skin of her face is perfect, but behind it lie eighty titanium screws that hold together the bones that were shattered when she hit the unbreakable windscreen of her car.<br><br>Unrecognizable to her peers and colleagues, Charlotte finds it impossible to resume her former life. Instead, she floats invisibly through a world of fashion nightclubs and edgy Internet projects, where image and reality are indistinguishable.<br><br>During her recovery in Rockford, she had met another Charlotte, the plain-looking teenage daughter of her former best friend. Young Charlotte, alienated from parents and friends, has come under the sway of two men: her uncle, a mentally unstable scholar of the Industrial Revolution, and an enigmatic high school teacher whom she seduces.<br><br>In following these tales to their eerie convergence, <i>Look at Me</i> is both a send-up of image culture in America and a mystery of human identity. Egan illuminates the difficulties of shaping an inner life in a culture obsessed with surfaces and asks whether "truth" can have any meaning in an era when reality itself has become a style. <br><br>Written with powerful intelligence and grace, <i>Look at Me</i> clearly establishes Jennifer Egan as one of the most daring and gifted novelists of her generation.</p><p>"<i>Look At Me</i> is original, bold, haunting in the range and depth of its psychological acuity.

De Bono argues that conventional vertical thinking often inhibits our ability to solve problems and come up with new ideas. He then shows that lateral thinking is a far easier and more natural way to generate simple, sound and effective ideas and offers guidance on how to develop your own ability to think laterally. Lateral thinking is a technique that anyone can learn and benefit from and you do not have to be a genius to benefit from it and generate ideas and solutions.</p><p>EDWARD DE BONO studied at Christ Church, Oxford (as a Rhodes Scholar). He also holds a PhD from Cambridge and an MD from the University of Malta. He has held appointments at the universities of Oxford, London, Cambridge and Harvard. In 1967 de Bono invented the now commonly used term &#39;lateral thinking&#39; and, for many thousands, indeed millions, of people worldwide, his name has since become a symbol of creativity and new thinking. He has written numerous books, which have been translated into 34 languages, and his advice is sought by Nobel laureates and world leaders alike.&nbsp;� "In this extremely well-written book Dr. de Bono attempts to describe the nature of a creative form of thinking and ways in which it can be developed." --<i>Times</i></p><h2>Beyond Little Hearts for His Glory</h2><p>As your child grows older, are you longing to hold onto a short, enjoyable school day, yet wondering how to cover all of the skill areas?

An avid sailor and pilot, Woods lives in New York City, Florida, and Maine.<b>1</b><p>Elaine&#x2019;s, late.<br>Stone Barrington breezed into the restaurant and found his former NYPD partner, Dino Bacchetti, waiting for him, Scotch in hand.<br>A waiter set a Knob Creek on the rocks before Stone, and he took a large sip.<br>&#x201c;Where have you been?&#x201d; Dino asked.<br>&#x201c;You mean for the past week?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been gone a week?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dino, remember when I went to Lakeland, Florida, to ground school for the new airplane? For a week?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s where you&#x2019;ve been?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;ve been in Vero Beach, Florida, for flight training.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;For a week?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;For three days.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You have a new airplane?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not exactly. I had the engine removed from my Piper Malibu Mirage and replaced with a turbine&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a jet engine, turning a propeller. So now it&#x2019;s called a JetProp, and it&#x2019;s like a new airplane, and because it&#x2019;s like a new airplane, my insurance company insisted I have flight training in it from a guy named John Mariani, in Vero Beach.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Whatever you say.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dino, why don&#x2019;t you remember any of this? How much have you had to drink?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You think I&#x2019;m drinking too much?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You seem to be in a state.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What sort of state?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The word stupor leaps to mind.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Genevieve will be here in a few minutes,&#x201d; Dino said. Genevieve James was Dino&#x2019;s girlfriend, a nurse in the ER at a nearby hospital.<br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;When she gets here, don&#x2019;t leave me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in some sort of trouble.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What kind of trouble?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, but if you&#x2019;re here, she won&#x2019;t hurt me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m not getting in the middle of this,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;Just sit there in your chair and don&#x2019;t say anything, and it&#x2019;ll be all right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay. I&#x2019;ll just sit here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Stone?&#x201d; Dino was looking over Stone&#x2019;s shoulder, toward the door.<br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Have you seen Lance Cabot lately?&#x201d; Cabot was the newly appointed deputy director for operations of the CIA. Both Dino and Stone had done consulting work for him.<br>&#x201c;Not lately.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, he looks like shit,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s aged years.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How do you know this?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m looking at him right now.&#x201d;<br>Stone turned and looked toward the door. Lance Cabot stood there, looking, as Dino had said, years older. He was also a bit disheveled, needed a haircut, and had at least a three-day growth of beard. His face was bruised.<br>&#x201c;Good God, you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>Lance was, ordinarily, the most fastidious of men, always perfectly dressed and groomed. Stone watched as Frank, one of the two headwaiters, greeted him and led him to a table at the rear of the restaurant.<br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t even look at us,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;Something&#x2019;s wrong. . . . Uh-oh,&#x201d; Dino said.<br>&#x201c;What now?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Genevieve.&#x201d;<br>Stone turned to see the beautiful Genevieve enter the restaurant and head for their table. They both stood, while Dino held her chair, a sure sign of fear.<br>&#x201c;How are you, Genevieve?&#x201d; Stone said, giving her a kiss.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m very well, Stone,&#x201d; she said, ignoring Dino. &#x201c;How was your Malibu training?&#x201d;<br>Stone shot a glance at Dino, who was looking very uncomfortable. &#x201c;Hard work and great fun. The new airplane is faster, smoother, and quieter, only it&#x2019;s not a Malibu anymore; it&#x2019;s called a JetProp.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I remember,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going nuts,&#x201d; Dino said.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Lance just came in again, and he looks perfectly fine.&#x201d;<br>Stone turned and looked, and there he was, younger, undisheveled, unbruised, and perfectly groomed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re both going nuts,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>Lance came over to the table and greeted them all, shaking their hands. &#x201c;Good evening,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Lance,&#x201d; Dino said, &#x201c;you should be working as a magician.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I beg your pardon?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because, in addition to standing here, you&#x2019;re sitting back there.&#x201d; Dino pointed.<br>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s my older brother, Barton Cabot.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ahhhhh,&#x201d; Dino and Stone said, simultaneously.<br>&#x201c;He came in ahead of me while I finished a phone call in the car. If you&#x2019;ll excuse me, I&#x2019;m going to join him, but Stone, I&#x2019;d like to speak with you alone, after we&#x2019;ve ordered dinner.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Stone said. In his experience, when Lance spoke to him alone, trouble invariably followed.<br>Lance went to join his brother.<br>&#x201c;Eerie resemblance,&#x201d; Genevieve said.<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Dino agreed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like Lance can know exactly how he&#x2019;ll look in a few years.&#x201d;<br>Genevieve spoke to Dino for the first time. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s how you&#x2019;re going to look when I&#x2019;m finished with you,&#x201d; she said.<br>Stone made a point of inspecting a row of photographs of Elaine&#x2019;s regulars on the opposite wall.<br>Elaine came over and sat down, exchanging kisses with Genevieve. Dino looked relieved to have her there. &#x201c;So?&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;I just got in,&#x201d; Stone replied.<br>&#x201c;From where?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;From Vero Beach, Florida.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What for?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dino will explain it to you,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>Lance came and tapped Stone on the shoulder. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go into the next room for a minute,&#x201d; he said.<br>Dino looked anxious. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be all right,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Elaine is here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll help Genevieve,&#x201d; Dino said.<br>Stone got up and followed Lance into the dining room next door, where people occasionally threw parties and which Elaine used for overflow when the main room was full. They sat down at a table.<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know you had a brother,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t had a brother for many years. Until tonight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Does he live in New York?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Lance said.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I have no idea where he lives. Neither does he. That&#x2019;s the difficult thing.&#x201d;<br>Stone settled in for a story.</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>Stone thought Lance looked as though he needed a drink.<br>&#x201c;Can I get you a drink, Lance?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thank you, no. We&#x2019;ve got a flap on&#x2014;two agents missing in Afghanistan&#x2014;and I have a meeting with the director in two hours.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In the middle of the night?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I have to make a recommendation,&#x201d; Lance said. &#x201c;We think we know where they are: Do we send in more people to get them and risk the lives of a hundred men, or do we call in an air strike and kill everybody.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Including the two agents?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the decision. There&#x2019;s a chopper waiting for me at the West Side helipad. That&#x2019;s why I can&#x2019;t deal with this right now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Deal with what?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My brother, Barton.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Start at the beginning, Lance.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My brother is four years older than I. Barton has been a star all his life: In school, in sports, wherever he went, he was always the star. Our mother died in childbirth with me. When I was twelve, our father died, and Barton became a surrogate father. He joined the Marines during the war in Vietnam, right out of Harvard; got a commission, led a platoon. I was at Harvard then. By the time it was over he was a colonel, commanding a regiment. Nobody in the Marines had advanced so quickly since World War Two. He was sent to the War College and told he would be a general before long, perhaps a future chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sounds like a spectacular career.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It was, until he abruptly resigned his commission and disappeared.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Disappeared?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nobody could find him. I tried and failed. When I was giving my commencement speech at my graduation I looked down and saw him in the audience, but when the thing was over, he had disappeared again. I didn&#x2019;t see him again until tonight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So he abandoned you when you were in college?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not entirely. My fees were paid, and a generous check arrived every month from a trust he had set up to receive my inheritance, since I was not yet of age. I wrote to him in care of the bank, but my letter was returned.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But you heard from him tonight?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not exactly. I had a call earlier this evening from a hospital in New York, saying that the police had found him, three days ago, unconscious, on the street. He had been beaten and, apparently, robbed, since he had no money or identification. His wristwatch had been taken, too. He was unconscious for around thirty hours, and when he woke, he didn&#x2019;t know who he was. The police tried to identify him, and today they finally got a match on his fingerprints and got hold of his service record, where I was listed as his next of kin. Somebody at the Pentagon recognized my name and called me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Has Barton recovered his memory?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Somewhat. He knows his name, he remembers me, but not much else. No one has been able to find an address for him, since his wallet was stolen. That&#x2019;s why I need your help.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What do you want me to do?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;His doctor told me that this sort of amnesia is usually temporary; the memory comes back in bits and pieces. It&#x2019;s a good sign that he has begun to remember. The hospital had to discharge him, since he has recovered from the beating and he has a next of kin. They released him to me tonight. But I can&#x2019;t take him back to Langley with me, not in the middle of this crisis.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do you want me to find him a hotel?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s a good idea just yet; he needs to regain his memory before he can be left alone.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I suppose I could put him up at my house for a couple of days,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;Thank you, Stone. I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;ll be any trouble; he&#x2019;s quite docile. I&#x2019;d also like you, perhaps with Dino&#x2019;s help, to find out where he lives and, when he recovers himself, take him to his home.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But you don&#x2019;t have any idea at all where he lives?&#x201d;<br>Lance shook his head. &#x201c;None.&#x201d; He looked at his watch. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a car waiting to take me to the helipad. Come and meet Barton.&#x201d; He got up and led Stone into the main dining room.<br>Barton Cabot was sitting at his table, talking in a companionable way with Elaine, who was sitting with him.<br>&#x201c;Stone,&#x201d; Lance said, &#x201c;this is my brother.&#x201d;<br>Barton rose and extended his hand. &#x201c;Barton Cabot,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Elaine and I were just catching up.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know Elaine?&#x201d; Lance asked.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s an old customer,&#x201d; Elaine said. &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t seen him for at least twenty years.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I remember being here,&#x201d; Barton said, &#x201c;but not how I got here or why.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; Lance said. He sat down and turned to his brother. &#x201c;Barton, I have to return to my office right now, but Stone, here, who is a good friend, is going to put you up at his house for a few days. You&#x2019;ll be very comfortable there.&#x201d; He slipped a card and some money into his jacket pocket. &#x201c;My number is there, if you need to reach me. We&#x2019;ll catch up in a few days.&#x201d;<br>Barton nodded. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s very good of you, Stone, to put me up,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;After all, I&#x2019;m a perfect stranger, even to myself.&#x201d;<br>Stone shrugged. &#x201c;Any brother of Lance&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br>Lance stood up and motioned for Stone to follow him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very grateful for this, Stone,&#x201d; he said as they walked toward the door. He took a card from his pocket and scribbled a number on the back. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my cell number,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call you tomorrow to see how he is, but if there&#x2019;s any sort of emergency, you can reach me, night or day, at that number. He seems to be about your size; can you loan him some clothes?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure, but first let him have some dinner, then I&#x2019;ll get him home and to bed.&#x201d; They shook hands, and Lance went outside, got into a black SUV at the curb and was driven away.<br>Stone turned and went back to Barton Cabot&#x2019;s table. As he passed his own table he heard Genevieve and Dino.<br>&#x201c;If you would just tell me what this is about,&#x201d; Dino was pleading.<br>&#x201c;You know what it&#x2019;s about,&#x201d; Genevieve replied.<br>Stone kept walking. He sat down with Elaine and Barton and ordered some pasta, and the three of them had a quiet chat for a while. Barton kept up nicely, offered an opinion once in a while, and was charming, even witty. But he said nothing that seemed to require any direct memory of his circumstances.<br>Stone gave Barton his card, and he tucked it into a jacket pocket. &#x201c;Thank you, Stone,&#x201d; he said.<br>Well, Stone thought, at least he can remember my name. He excused himself to go to the men&#x2019;s room, and when he returned, both Barton and Elaine were no longer at the table. He saw Elaine sitting up front with some customers and walked up to her. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Barton?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&#x201c;He left,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Got into a cab. I put his dinner on your tab.&#x201d;<br>Stone hurried outside and looked up and down Second Avenue. There was no sign of Barton Cabot.<br>&#x201c;Oh, shit,&#x201d; he said aloud to himself.</p><p><b>3</b></p><p>Stone went back into Elaine&#x2019;s and sat down with Dino and Genevieve, both of whom, he was grateful to see, had fallen silent.<br>&#x201c;Dino, I need your help,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d better be going,&#x201d; Genevieve said, standing up.<br>&#x201c;No, don&#x2019;t go,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a night shift starting in a few minutes,&#x201d; she said. She pecked Stone on the cheek, fetched Dino a sweeping, openhanded blow to the back of the head, mussing his hair, and left.<br>&#x201c;Why do I think you got off light?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t know what it&#x2019;s about,&#x201d; Dino said, smoothing his hair.<br>&#x201c;You may never know,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;I need your help.&#x201d; He explained about Lance&#x2019;s brother.<br>&#x201c;And you let him walk out of here?&#x201d; Dino asked, incredulous.<br>&#x201c;I had to go to the john, all right? And besides, he was sitting, chatting with Elaine.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know Elaine spends her evening cruising tables.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>A Cross Stitch Christmas: Handmade Treasures (Better Homes and Gardens)</h2><p>Filled with ninety-nine projects that appeal to stitchers with a wide variety of interests, a collection of timeless designs includes all levels of difficulty and features the Cross Stitch and Country Crafts Mark of Excellence seal. 30,000 first printing.</p><p></p><h2>Bat-Manga!: The Secret History of Batman in Japan (Pantheon Graphic Library)</h2><p>The two hottest genres in comics gleefully collide head-on, as the most beloved American superhero gets the coolest Japanese manga makeover ever. <br><br>In 1966, during the height of the first Batman craze, a weekly Japanese manga anthology for boys, <i>Shonen King</i>, licensed the rights to commission its own Batman and Robin stories.

During the last twenty years, he has amassed the most comprehensive collection of vintage Japanese Batman toys and memorabilia in the world.The campy, Pop-art-infused Batman television series that dbuted in 1966 was not just a hit in the U.S.; it also set off an international wave of Batmania. A Tokyo publisher licensed the comic-book rights and new weekly Batman adventures appeared for more than a year, drawn by Jiro Kuwata, a manga prodigy who co-created the popular cyborg superhero 8-Man. His work, never reprinted and previously untranslated, was so little known here that, until its rediscovery by Kidd and Ferris, even DC Comics, Batman s publisher, was unaware of its existence. Kuwata, an action virtuoso, employed hypnotic geometrical motifs within his panels, incorporating realistic Batman and Robin figures into an exaggeratedly cartoonish style. His Batman fights villains like the shape-shifting Clayface and Go-Go the Magician, as well as typically Japanese oversized robots, insects, and dinosaurs. <br>Copyright �2008<i> Click here to subscribe to The New Yorker</i></p><h2>Introduction to Tantra: A Vision of Totality</h2><p>No one has ever talked about tantra with such clarity, coherence and simplicity. Religious Studies Review</p><p>What is tantra? Who is qualified to practice it? How should it be practiced? What are the results? According to Buddhism, every human being has the potential to achieve profound and lasting happiness. And according to the tantric teachings of Buddhism, this remarkable transformation can be realized very quickly if we utilize all aspects of our human energy - especially the energy of our desires. <p>Introduction to Tantra is the best available clarification of a subject that is often misunderstood. In this book, Lama Yeshe, who was a fully realized tantric meditator, scholar, and yogi, outlines the entire tantric path.</p>: Lama Thubten Yeshe (1935-1984) was born in Tibet and educated at the great Sera Monastic University. He fled the Chinese oppression in 1959 and in the late 1960s, with his chief disciples, Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche, began teaching Buddhism to Westerners at their Kopan Monastery, Kathmandu, Nepal. In 1975 they founded the international Buddhist organization, the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT), which now has about 80 branches worldwide.</p><h2>Prism of the Night: A Biography of Anne Rice</h2><p>Recounts the life of a writer best known for vampire novels but also the author of erotica under pseudonyms, and discusses her work</p><p>Given the macabre and often lurid subject matter of Anne Rice's fiction, one would imagine that a good biography of her would uncover some pretty spicy details, and, in fact, Katherine Ramsland's <i>Prism of the Night</i> does a pretty good job of balancing analysis of Rice's work with a probing and revealing investigation of her life. Ramsland, a professor of philosophy at Rutgers University, extensively interviewed Rice for the book, and Stan Rice (Anne's poet-husband) read the manuscript. Throughout, Ramsland fulfills the promise of her introduction: "My approach combines psychological interpretation with philosophical themes. As I read the novels, I looked for qualities that transcended genre, while also developing autobiographical sketches.... This book is the result of an involved and sincere attempt to trace in her writing elements of literary creativity manifested in psychological sources." Often, close readings of the fiction are coupled with commentary about the key events (emotional, personal, literary, etc.) in Rice's life that likely impacted her characters and plots. The section on the death of Rice's daughter as it manifests in <i>Interview with the Vampire</i> is especially wrenching. The book will be appreciated by fans for its extensive direct citation of Rice and her closest friends and relatives, and for its diverse collection of photographs. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i>Exciting life of bestselling gothicist Anne Rice, by psychologist/philosopher Ramsland (Philosophy/Rutgers). Benefiting from Rice's input, this will have to be thought of as an ``authorized'' biography, although Ramsland is her own writer--and at times a heavy-going writer, bearing what might be called the Curse of the Jungians, an overdense working out of Rice's sea-changes and gender shiftings. Born in New Orleans and named Howard Allen, Rice has always been an outsider with strong male traits and since childhood has refused to accept victimization by dress and gender codes. Like Orson Welles, she and her three sisters were raised from infancy to be geniuses, allowed to stay up late, dabble at will and read what they wished, and skip school, all with the doting permission of their alcoholic mother, Katherine, and highly moral Catholic father, Howard. Katherine's death at 48 was the deepest blow Rice had ever experienced (alcoholism claimed many family members at that very age and might have claimed Rice as well had she and her brilliant poet-husband Stan Rice not agreed in 1979 to total abstinence)--and was followed by her daughter Michele's death from leukemia at age five. These events fed in a disguised fashion into her first successful novel, Interview with the Vampire, and into her following vampire novels, which, Ramsland shows, granted immortality to her dead mother and daughter--until Rice killed them off and arose psychically refreshed. Despite success, she writes as she wishes: Later novels were audience-losers, as were pseudonymous porno novels, until she returned to her vampire chronicles. Ramsland's study climaxes in the middle--with the deeply moving death of Michele as recaptured by Stan's electric elegy--and her later knifework on the Rice psyche and its fictions gets tiresome. Still, the book is mostly quite gripping, and deserves to hit big and probably will. (Sixteen pages of b&amp;w photograph--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Light itself is different and Vance's landscapes &#x2014;described in language that is lyrical, seductive, and partly self-invented &#x2014;are wild and surreal, full of opportunity and danger. On the Dying Earth, the rules of physics as we know them have been amended and replaced by magic. The laws of evolution have spun out creatures that are humanoid, hybrid, and often terrifying. The interpenetrating world of ghosts is equally fantastic. Religion and philosophy are diversified and rewoven into myriad theories, creeds, and dogmas. Human culture is archaic, vaguely medieval European or feudal Japanese. There is nothing quaint or allegorical about the Dying Earth stories. We're not in Oz anymore, nor Narnia either. Voldemar is a harmless grouch compared to Chun the Unavoidable. Yet, at the same time, these works are as weirdly funny as the poetry and journals of Edward Lear or the fantastic yarns of Dr. Seuss.Jack Vance is one of the greats of science fiction. He has been writing for more than 60 years, and in 1997 was honored as a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America.

Rudd was the charismatic chairman of the Columbia chapter of SDS, Students for a Democratic Society, the largest radical student organization in the United States. After a violent police bust, the Columbia occupation turned into a student strike that closed down the entire campus, turning Rudd into a national symbol of student revolt. Rudd went on to become the cofounder of the Weatherman faction of SDS, which took control of the student organization and helped organize the notorious Days of Rage in Chicago in 1969. </p><p>But Mark Rudd wanted revolution. </p><p>Rudd and his friends sought to end war, racism, and injustice&#x2014;by any means necessary, even violence. After a tragic turn that led to the death of three people, who were killed when the bombs they were making in a Greenwich Village town house exploded, they transformed themselves into the Weather Underground Organization. By the end of 1970, after a string of nonlethal bombings by the organization, Rudd, now one of the FBI's Most Wanted, went into hiding for more than seven years before turning himself in to great media fanfare. </p><p>In this gripping narrative, Rudd speaks out about this tumultuous period, the role he played in its crucial events, and its aftermath, revealing the drama and tension, as well as the na�vet� of young activists, fighting in the name of peace and social justice, who believed that their actions mattered. </p><p>"I've spoken and answered questions at scores of colleges, high schools, community centers, and theaters about why my friends and I opted for violent revolution, and how I've changed my thinking and how I haven't, and most of all, about the parallels between then and now," Rudd writes.

Here is a brave book." &#x2015;<i>The Charlotte Observer </i><br><br> "Berry says that these recent essays mostly say again what he has said before. His faithful readers may think he hasn't, however, said any of it better before." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)<br><br> "His refusal to abandon the local for the global, to sacrifice neighborliness, community integrity, and economic diversity for access to Wal-Mart, has never seemed more appealing, nor his questions of personal accountability more powerful." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br> <p>There are those in America today who seem to feel we must audition for our citizenship, with "patriot" offered as the badge for those found narrowly worthy. Let this book stand as Wendell Berry's application, for he is one of those faithful, devoted critics envisioned by the Founding Fathers to be the life's blood and very future of the nation they imagined. <i>Citizenship Papers</i> collects nineteen new essays, from celebrations of exemplary lives to critiques of American life, including "A Citizen's Response [to the new National Security Strategy]"&#x2015;a ringing call of caution to a nation standing on the brink of global catastrophe.</p></p><p><b>Wendell Berry</b> is the author of more than fifty books of poetry, fiction, and essays. He was recently awarded the National Humanities Medal, the Cleanth Brooks Medal for Lifetime Achievement by the Fellowship of Southern Writers, and the Louis Bromfield Society Award. For more than forty years he has lived and farmed with his wife, Tanya, in Kentucky.<br>Berry says that these recent essays mostly say again what he has said before. His faithful readers may think he hasn't, however, said any of it <i>better</i> before. So it always seems with Berry, one of English's finest stylists, as perspicuous as T. H. Huxley at his best and as perspicacious as John Ruskin at his. Like Huxley, Berry cares about how life persists; like Ruskin, about how economics and politics impinge upon life. Naturally, then, his constant subject is the fostering of life, especially human life--in a word, agriculture. As Huxley in "On a Piece of Chalk" (1865) shows how a little natural chalk implicates vast evolutionary processes, Berry in "Let the Farm Judge" shows how one facet of agriculture--sound sheep raising--implicates all of it. Like Ruskin, Berry descries more deeply than others the dangers major crises reveal; if Ruskin's "Storm Cloud of the Nineteenth Century" (1884) is the most penetrating critique of industrialism in his day (the storm cloud was air pollution), Berry's pieces on 9/11 and official reaction to it constitute the most powerful response to today's global industrialism. In those essays and throughout, Berry sees America persisting, as it has for a century, to choose industrialism over agrarianism. He hopefully counsels reversing that choice and, so doing, again embracing life and community. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This paperback version contains a preview chapter from the upcoming conclusion to the trilogy, <i>Dragons of a Vanished Moon.</i><br></p><p>Dragonlance's dynamic duo--the inimitable Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman--continues to do no wrong, reviving the once-ailing world of Krynn with yet another solid book, the second in their War of Souls series. Which is not to say, of course, that Krynn itself is doing well. Far from it: as you might remember from the trilogy's debut, <i>Dragons of a Fallen Sun</i>, creepy Joan-of-Arc-type Mina is spreading the influence of her One God even further over the previously godless land. To top that off, the cursed magical shield protecting the Silvanesti crumbled with the death of the great green Cyan Bloodbane (who had been masquerading as an elf), and the hated Beryl has made a move on the Citadel of Light and the lands of the Qualinesti. And just in case you didn't read <i>Fallen Sun</i>, Weis and Hickman take great pains to bring you up to speed in the first chapter.<p> What follows in <i>Dragons of a Lost Star</i> is the satisfying resolution to most of these threads, although--like it or not--that means a <i>lot</i> of interplay among the elves. But a literally earth-shattering finale with Beryl in Qualinost amply makes up for it, and that's just the appetizer for the main dish: the true identity of Mina's mysterious One God is revealed at last. Throw in some typical Tas antics for good measure (you've got to love that Device of Time Journeying), and you can count on being left antsy for this trilogy's concluding installment. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>The people of Krynn have known war in past ages.

Trollope creates a disturbing picture of the lives of the laboring Irish poor both before and during the famine.</p><p>Anthony Trollope (1815-1882) started his writing career while working in Ireland as a postal surveyor. Travelling around the country, Trollope gained knowledge of the country and its people which proved to be useful material for his first two novels, The Macdermots of Ballycloran (1847) and The Kellys and the O&#39;Kellys (1848). Trollope soon started writing fiercely, producing a series entitled Chronicles of Barsetshire. The Warden, the first in the series, was published in 1855. Barchester Towers (1857), the comic masterpiece, Doctor Thorne (1858), Framley Parsonage (1861), The Small House at Allington (1864) and The Last Chronicle of Barset (1867) followed, portraying events in an imaginary English county of Barsetshire. In 1867, Trollope left the Post Office to run as a candidate for the Parliament. Having lost at the elections, Trollope focused on his writing. A satire from his later writing, The Way We Live Now (1875) is often viewed as Trollope&#39;s major work, however, his popularity and writing reputation diminished at the later stage of his life. Anthony Trollope died in London in 1882.</p><h2>Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages</h2><p>Examines the marriages of five Victorian couples--the Carlyles, Ruskins, Dickenses, Mills, and George Eliot and George Henry Lewes--to demonstrate the classic strengths and weaknesses of the institution of marriage</p><p>of the married couple as the smallest political unit, Phyllis Rose uses as examples the marriages of five Victorian writers who wrote about their own lives with unusual candor.<b>Phyllis Rose</b> is a professor of English at Wesleyan University.

But Malcolm X, the most famous minister in the Nation of Islam-a sect many white Americans deemed a hate cult-saw the potential in Clay, not just for boxing greatness, but as a means of spreading the Nation's message. The two became fast friends, keeping their interactions secret from the press for fear of jeopardizing Clay's career. Clay began living a double life-a patriotic "good Negro" in public, and a radical reformer behind the scenes. Soon, however, their friendship would sour, with disastrous and far-reaching consequences.<br><br>Based on previously untapped sources, from Malcolm's personal papers to FBI records, <i>Blood Brothers</i> is the first book to offer an in-depth portrait of this complex bond. Acclaimed historians Randy Roberts and Johnny Smith reconstruct the worlds that shaped Malcolm and Clay, from the boxing arenas and mosques, to postwar New York and civil rights-era Miami. In an impressively detailed account, they reveal how Malcolm molded Cassius Clay into Muhammad Ali, helping him become an international symbol of black pride and black independence. Yet when Malcolm was barred from the Nation for criticizing the philandering of its leader, Elijah Muhammad, Ali turned his back on Malcolm-a choice that tragically contributed to the latter's assassination in February 1965.<br><br>Malcolm's death marked the end of a critical phase of the civil rights movement, but the legacy of his friendship with Ali has endured. We inhabit a new era where the roles of entertainer and activist, of sports and politics, are more entwined than ever before. <i>Blood Brothers</i> is the story of how Ali redefined what it means to be a black athlete in America-after Malcolm first enlightened him. An extraordinary narrative of love and deep affection, as well as deceit, betrayal, and violence, this story is a window into the public and private lives of two of our greatest national icons, and the tumultuous period in American history that they helped to shape.<br></p><p>Randy Roberts is a distinguished professor of history at Purdue University.

Screamer&#x2019;s was packed tonight, full of women wearing leather and men who looked like they had advanced degrees in violent crime.</p><p>Darius and his companion fit right in.</p><p>Except they actually were killers.</p><p>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re really going to do this?&#x201d; Tohrment asked him.</p><p>Darius glanced across the shallow table. The other vampire&#x2019;s eyes met his own. &#x201c;Yeah. I am.&#x201d;</p><p>Tohrment nursed his Scotch and smiled grimly. Only the very tips of his fangs showed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re crazy, D.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You should know.&#x201d;</p><p>Tohrment tilted his glass in deference. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re raising the bar. You want to take an innocent girl, who has no idea what the hell she&#x2019;s getting into, and put her transition in the hands of someone like Wrath. That&#x2019;s whacked.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He isn&#x2019;t evil. In spite of the way he looks.&#x201d; Darius finished his beer. &#x201c;And show a little respect.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I respect the hell out of him. But it&#x2019;s a bad idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I need him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You sure about that?&#x201d;</p><p>A woman wearing a micromini, thigh-high boots, and a bustier made of chains trolled by their table. Her eyes glittered from behind two pounds of mascara, and she worked her walk as if her hips were double-jointed.</p><p>Darius gave her a pass. Sex was not on his mind tonight.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s my daughter, Tohr.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a half-breed, D. And you know how he feels about humans.&#x201d; Tohrment shook his head. &#x201c;My great-great-grandmother was one, and you don&#x2019;t see me yakking that up around him.&#x201d;</p><p>Darius lifted his hand to catch their waitress&#x2019;s eye and pointed at his empty bottle and Tohrment&#x2019;s nearly dry glass. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to let another one of my children die. Not if there&#x2019;s a possibility I can save her. And anyway, there&#x2019;s no telling whether she&#x2019;ll even go through the change. She could end up living a happy life, never knowing about my side. It&#x2019;s happened before.&#x201d;</p><p>And he hoped his daughter would be spared. Because if she went through her transition, if she came out alive on the other side as a vampire, she was going to be hunted as they all were.</p><p>&#x201c;Darius, if he does it at all, he&#x2019;ll do it because he owes you. Not because he wants to.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take him any way I can get him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But what are you giving her? He&#x2019;s about as nurturing as a sawed-off, and that first time can be rough, even if you&#x2019;ve been prepared. Which she hasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to talk to her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And how&#x2019;s that going to go? You&#x2019;re just going to walk up to her and say, &#x2018;Hey, I know you&#x2019;ve never seen me before, but I&#x2019;m your dad. Oh, and guess what? You&#x2019;ve won the evolutionary lottery: You&#x2019;re a vampire. Let&#x2019;s go to Disneyland!&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hate you right now.&#x201d;</p><p>Tohrment leaned forward, his thick shoulders shifting under black leather. &#x201c;You know I got your back. I&#x2019;m just thinking you should reconsider.&#x201d; There was a heavy pause. &#x201c;Maybe I could do it.&#x201d;</p><p>Darius shot him a dry look. &#x201c;You want to try and get back into your house after the fact? Wellsie will stake you through the heart and leave you for the sun, my friend.&#x201d;</p><p>Tohrment winced. &#x201c;Good point.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And then she&#x2019;ll come looking for me.&#x201d;</p><p>Both males shuddered.</p><p>&#x201c;Besides...&#x201d; Darius leaned back as the waitress put their drinks down. He waited until she left, even though hard-core rap was pumping all around them. &#x201c;Besides, we&#x2019;re living in dangerous times. If something happens to me&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take care of her.&#x201d;</p><p>Darius clapped his friend on the shoulder. &#x201c;I know you will.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But Wrath is better.&#x201d; There was no jealousy in the remark. It was a statement of fact.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no one like him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And thank God for that,&#x201d; Tohrment said with a half smile.</p><p>Their band of brothers, a tight circle of strong-backed warriors who traded information and fought together, were of the same opinion. Wrath was off the chain when it came to the business of vengeance, and he hunted their enemies with a single-minded purpose that bordered on the insane. He was the last of his line, the only purebred vampire left on the planet, and though his race revered him as its king, he despised his status.</p><p>It was almost tragic that he was the best bet Darius&#x2019;s half-breed daughter had of surviving. Wrath&#x2019;s blood, so strong, so untainted, would increase the chances of her getting through the transition if it hit her. But Tohrment wasn&#x2019;t off the mark. It was like turning a virgin over to a thug.</p><p>With a sudden rush, the crowd shifted, people backing into each other. They were making way for someone. Or something.</p><p>&#x201c;Shit. Here he comes,&#x201d; Tohrment muttered. He tossed back his Scotch, swallowing it whole. &#x201c;No offense, but I&#x2019;m outtie. This is not a conversation I need to be a part of.&#x201d;</p><p>Darius watched the sea of humans split as they steered clear of an imposing, dark shadow that towered over them. The flight response was a good survival reflex.</p><p>Wrath was six feet, six inches of pure terror dressed in leather. His hair was long and black, falling straight from a widow&#x2019;s peak. Wraparound sunglasses hid eyes that no one had ever seen revealed. Shoulders were twice the size of most males&#x2019;. With a face that was both aristocratic and brutal, he looked like the king he was by birthright and the soldier he&#x2019;d become by destiny.</p><p>And that wave of menace rolling ahead of him was one hell of a calling card.</p><p>As the cool hatred hit Darius, he tilted his fresh beer back and drank deeply.</p><p>He hoped to God he was doing the right thing.</p><p>Beth Randall looked up as her editor leaned his hip on her desk. His eyes went straight to the vee of her shirt.</p><p>&#x201c;Working late again,&#x201d; he murmured.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Dick.&#x201d;</p><p>Shouldn&#x2019;t you be getting home to your wife and two kids? she mentally added.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Editing a piece for Tony.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know, there are other ways of impressing me.&#x201d;</p><p>Yeah, she could just imagine.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you read my e-mail, Dick? I went down to the police station this afternoon and talked with Jos� and Ricky. They swear a gun dealer&#x2019;s moved into town. They&#x2019;ve found two modified Magnums on drug dealers.&#x201d;</p><p>Dick reached out to pat her shoulder, stroking it as he took his hand back. &#x201c;You just keep working the blotter. Let the big boys worry about the violent crimes. We wouldn&#x2019;t want anything to happen to that pretty face of yours.&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled, eyes growing hooded as his gaze lingered on her lips.</p><p>That stare routine had gotten old three years ago, she thought. Right after she&#x2019;d started working for him.</p><p>A paper bag. What she needed was a paper bag to pull over her head whenever she talked with him. Maybe with a picture of Mrs. Dick taped to the front.</p><p>&#x201c;Would you like me to give you a ride home?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>Only if it were raining thumbtacks and hairpins, you letch.</p><p>&#x201c;No, thanks.&#x201d; Beth turned back to her computer screen and hoped he&#x2019;d take the hint.</p><p>Eventually he wandered off, probably heading for the bar across the street that most of the reporters hit before going home. Caldwell, New York, wasn&#x2019;t exactly a hotbed of opportunity for any journalist, but Dick&#x2019;s big boys sure liked keeping up the appearance of carrying a heavy social burden. They relished cozying up to the bar at Charlie&#x2019;s and talking about the days when they&#x2019;d worked at bigger, more important papers. For the most part they were just like Dick: middle-aged, middle-of-the-road men who were competent, but not extraordinary at what they did. Caldwell was big enough and close enough to New York City to have the nasty business of violent crimes, drug busts, and prostitution, so they were kept busy. But the Caldwell Courier Journal was not the Times, and none of them was ever going to win a Pulitzer.</p><p>It was rather sad.</p><p>Yeah, well, look in the mirror, Beth thought. She was just a beat reporter. She&#x2019;d never even worked at a national-level paper. So when she was in her fifties, unless things changed, she&#x2019;d have to be at a free press polishing classifieds to have a shot at reflected glory from her CCJ days.</p><p>She reached for the bag of M &amp; M&#x2019;s she&#x2019;d been nursing. The damn thing was empty. Again.</p><p>She should probably just go home. And pick up some Chinese down the street.</p><p>On her way out of the newsroom, which was an open space cut up into cubicles by flimsy gray partitions, she hit her buddy Tony&#x2019;s stash of Twinkies. Tony ate all the time. For him, there was no breakfast, lunch, and dinner: Consumption was a binary proposition. If he was awake, something was going into his mouth, and to keep himself supplied, his desk was a treasure trove of caloric depravity.</p><p>She peeled off the cellophane and couldn&#x2019;t believe she was biting into the artificial swill as she hit the lights and walked down the stairwell to Trade Street. Outside, the heat of July was a physical barrier between her and her apartment. Twelve straight blocks of hot and humid. Fortunately, the Chinese restaurant was halfway home and heavily air-conditioned. With any luck they&#x2019;d be busy tonight, so she&#x2019;d get to wait a while in the coolness.</p><p>When she was finished with the Twinkie, she flipped open her phone, hit speed dial, and put in an order for beef with broccoli. As she walked along, she looked at the familiar, grim landmarks. Along this stretch of Trade Street, there were only bars, strip clubs, and the occasional tattoo parlor. The Chinese food place and the Tex-Mex buffet were the only two restaurants. The rest of the buildings, which had been used as offices in the twenties, when downtown had been thriving, were vacant. She knew every crack in the sidewalk; she could time the traffic lights. And the patois of sounds drifting out of open doors and windows offered no surprises either.</p><p>McGrider&#x2019;s Bar was playing blues; Zero Sum had bleating techno coming out of its glass entrance; and the karaoke machines were fired up at Ruben&#x2019;s. Most of the places were reputable enough, but there were a couple she stayed away from on principle. Screamer&#x2019;s in particular catered to a scary-ass clientele. That was one door she wouldn&#x2019;t go through without a police escort.</p><p>As she measured the distance to the Chinese restaurant, a wave of fatigue hit her. God, it was humid. The air was so heavy she felt as if she were breathing water.</p><p>She had a feeling the exhaustion wasn&#x2019;t just about the weather. She&#x2019;d been pooped for weeks, and suspected she was dancing with depression. Her job was going nowhere. She was living in a place she didn&#x2019;t care about. She had few friends, no lover, and no romantic prospects. If she looked ahead ten years and pictured herself staying put in Caldwell with Dick and the big boys, she only saw more of the same routine: getting up, going to work, trying to make a difference, failing, going home alone.</p><p>Maybe she just needed out. Out of Caldwell. Out of the CCJ. Out of the electronic family of her alarm clock and the phone on her desk and the TV that kept her dreams away while she slept.</p><p>God knew there was nothing keeping her in town but habit. She hadn&#x2019;t spoken to any of her foster parents for years, so they wouldn&#x2019;t miss her. And the few friends she had were busy with their own families.</p><p>When she heard a leering whistle behind her, she rolled her eyes. That was the problem with working near the bars. On occasion you picked up gawkers.</p><p>The catcalls came next, and then, sure enough, two guys crossed the street at a jog and came after her. She looked around. She was heading away from the bars and into the long stretch of vacant buildings before the restaurants. The night was thick and dark, but at least there were streetlights and the occasional car passing.</p><p>&#x201c;I like your black hair,&#x201d; the big one said as he fell into step beside her. &#x201c;Mind if I touch it?&#x201d;</p><p>Beth knew better than to stop. They looked like college frat boys out for the summer, which meant they were just going to be annoying, but she didn&#x2019;t want to take any chances. Besides, the Chinese place was only five blocks up.</p><p>She reached into her purse anyway, searching for her pepper spray.</p><p>&#x201c;You need a ride somewhere?&#x201d; the big guy asked. &#x201c;My car&#x2019;s not far. Seriously, how &#x2019;bout you come with us? We could go for a little ride.&#x201d;</p><p>He grinned and winked at his buddy, as if the smooth rap was definitely going to get him laid. The crony laughed and circled her, his thin blond hair flopping as he skipped.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s ride her!&#x201d; the blond said.</p><p>Damn it, where was her spray?</p><p>The big one reached out, touching her hair, and she looked at him good and hard. With his polo shirt and his khaki shorts, he was BMOC handsome. Real all-American material.</p><p>When he smiled at her, she sped up, focusing on the dim neon glow of the Chinese place&#x2019;s sign. She was praying someone else would walk by, but heat had driven the pedestrian traffic indoors. There was no one around.</p><p>&#x201c;You want to tell me your name?&#x201d; all-American asked.</p><p>Her heart started banging in her chest. The spray was in her other bag.</p><p>Four more blocks.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll just pick a name for you. Let me think...How&#x2019;s pussycat sound?&#x201d;</p><p>The blond giggled.</p><p>She swallowed and took out her cell phone, just in case she needed to call 911.</p><p>Stay calm. Keep it together.</p><p>She pictured how good the rush of air-conditioning in the restaurant was going to feel as she went inside. Maybe she&#x2019;d wait and call a cab, just to make sure she got home without being further harassed by them.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, pussycat,&#x201d; all-American cooed. &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re going to like me.&#x201d;</p><p>Only three more blocks...</p><p>Just as she stepped off the curb to cross Tenth Street, he grabbed her around the waist. Her feet popped off the ground, and as he dragged her backward, he covered her mouth with a heavy palm. She fought like a madwoman, kicking and punching, and when she reached behind and belted him in the eye, his grip slipped. She lunged away from him, legs driving her heels hard into the pavement, breath trapped in her throat. A car went by out on Trade Street, and she yelled as its headlights flared.</p><p>But then he got her again.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to beg for it, bitch,&#x201d; all-American said in her ear as he put her in a choke hold. He wrenched her neck around until she thought it was going to snap and pulled her deeper into the shadows. She could smell his sweat and the college-boy cologne he wore, could hear the high-pitched laughter of his friend.</p><p>An alley. They were taking her into an alley.</p><p>Her stomach heaved, bile stinging her throat, and she jerked her body around furiously, trying to get free. Panic made her strong. But he was stronger.</p><p>He pushed her behind a Dumpster and pressed his body into hers. She drove her elbow into his ribs and kicked some more.</p><p>&#x201c;Goddamn it, get her arms!&#x201d;</p><p>She got in one good heel punch to the blond&#x2019;s shins before he caught her wrists and held them over her head.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, bitch, you&#x2019;re going to like this,&#x201d; all-American growled, trying to get his knee between her legs.</p><p>He ground her back against the building&#x2019;s brick wall, holding her in place by the throat. He had to use his other hand to rip open her shirt, and as soon as her mouth was free, she screamed. He slapped her hard, and she felt her lip split open. Blood rushed onto her tongue, pain stunning her.</p><p>&#x201c;You do tha...</p></p><h2>Hope for Animals and Their World: How Endangered Species Are Being Rescued from the Brink</h2><p><b>From world-renowned scientist Jane Goodall, as seen in the new National Geographic documentary <i>Jane</i>, comes an inspiring message about the future of the animal kingdom. </b><br><br>With the insatiable curiosity and conversational prose that have made her a bestselling author, Goodall - along with Cincinnati Zoo Director Thane Maynard - shares fascinating survival stories about the American Crocodile, the California Condor, the Black-Footed Ferret, and more; all formerly endangered species and species once on the verge of extinction whose populations are now being regenerated.<br><br>Interweaving her own first-hand experiences in the field with the compelling research of premier scientists, Goodall illuminates the heroic efforts of dedicated environmentalists and the truly critical need to protect the habitats of these beloved species.

Friends lie to friends. Children lie to their parents. Politicians lie to constituents. And, inevitably, husbands and wives lie to each other.<br><br>Lies between lovers can be highly electric; they have tremendous potential to both nurture and destroy a relationship. It is easy to underestimate the power that lies-even seemingly harmless lies-can wield in your marriage. <i>Tell Me No Lies</i> explores the complexity of honesty versus deception in marriage.<br><br><i>Tell Me No Lies</i> offers a riveting account of the lies we tell our partners (and ourselves) in marriage. Some people lie because they lack the nerve to tell their partners what they feel, while others are so terrified of hearing the truth that they encourage their mates to lie to them, thus falling into "Lie Invitee" behavior. This book examines the four marital stages-The Honeymoon, Emerging Differences, Freedom, and Together as Two-and how deception interferes with development in each of the stages. For example, couples in the Honeymoon stage are often under the illusion that they are perfectly content and have everything in common.<br> <br>This book also illustrates how each of these stages can go awry, leading to more dangerous lies such as those in: The Dark Side of the Honeymoon, when couples refuse to acknowledge any problems; the Stalemate, when couples fight and brutalize each other with exaggerated truths; and Freedom Unhinged, when independence outweighs togetherness and marital anarchy ensues.<br><br>Offering a new way of thinking about truth and deception, this book will help you understand the dynamics of your marriage in the context of the marital stages. If you can identify your marital stage, you can overcome the barriers to honesty and move on to a happier and more fulfilling marriage!<br></p><p>Dr. Ellyn Bader and Dr. Peter Pearson are internationally recognized experts on couples therapy and cofounders and directors of The Couples Institute in Menlo Park, California.

They are also the authors of In Quest of the Mythical Mate, which received the Clark Vincent Award for its outstanding contribution to the field of marital therapy from The California Association of Marriage and Family Therapists. They live in Menlo Park and have three daughters.<br><br>Judith D. Schwartz is a widely published writer with a specialty in psychology. The author of The Mother Puzzle, she lives in Bennington, Vermont with her husband, Tony Eprile, and their son, Brendan.<br>After 15 years "studying marital communication" as coordinators of the Couples Institute in Menlo Park, Calif., Bader and Pearson (a married couple themselves) share the secrets to uncovering, understanding and recovering from lies between husbands and wives. Based on the presumption that "everybody lies," this highly detailed manual explains why lying happens, how it harms relationships (and those who lie) and what the underlying motivations may be. With many examples from their practice and their own marriage, Bader and Pearson guide readers through the deceptive traps common to what they cast as each of the four stages of relationships: Honeymoon, Emerging Differences, Freedom to Explore and Together as Two. Examining the "dark side" of each stage, the authors show how "lies in a marriage cause wanton destruction." In the idyllic honeymoon phase, slight imperfections can provoke secret resentments, while differences between partners can later cause a "seething stalemate" if not balanced honestly and respectfully. Freedom to grow can slip into an "anything goes" mode, involving rebellious drinking or money dealings, or sexual infidelity. Even seemingly innocuous lies, intended to spare feelings and maintain equilibrium in a marriage, can backfire or become obsolete over time. At the book's end, Bader and Pearson provide a nine-step process for revealing a difficult truth. The rest of their self-help manual may be better used in conjunction with professional counseling, as it can be dauntingly complex. At least one chapter, addressing the "Lie Invitee," may push readers too far, leaving them feeling blamed for another's deception. Perhaps Bader and Pearson can guide clients through these difficult events in person, but their advice on the printed page may not offer enough help for couples in trouble.

RobbNYPD lieutenant Eve Dallas doesn&#x2019;t do glitz or glam, but she has no choice when Hollywood director Mason Roundtree and his wife, Connie Burkette, issue an invitation to dine with the cast of The Icove Agenda. Based on one of Eve&#x2019;s earlier cases, the movie is just wrapping up production, and everyone wants face time with the real Lieutenant Dallas. Everyone except actress K. T. Harris, who plays the part of Eve&#x2019;s partner, Delia Peabody, onscreen but in real life is just as bitchy to Eve as she is to everyone else. So when K. T.&#x2019;s body is found floating in the Roundtree and Burkette&#x2019;s penthouse lap pool, it really isn&#x2019;t that big of a surprise. The real challenge for Eve will be narrowing down her list of suspects since practically everyone at the dinner party had at least one motive for murder. Readers count on Robb to deliver the goods, and her thirty-fourth (!) Eve Dallas book will not disappoint. The plot is cleverly conceived, cinematically riveting, and sexily charming, and Eve is her usual no-nonsense self. --John Charles</p><h2>The Rise of False Messiahs: Carpathia&#39;s Evil Tricks (Left Behind: The Kids, No. 35)</h2><p>With over 10 million copies sold in the series, Left Behind: The Kids is a favorite of readers ages 10-14.

After a long career of being shot at, he&#x2019;s about to be retired. The mildly larcenous, backwater island of Mancreu is the ideal place to serve out his time, a former British colony in legal limbo, belching toxic clouds of waste and facing imminent destruction by an international community concerned for their own safety. The perfect place for Lester is also the perfect location for a multinational array of shady businesses. Hence the Black Fleet of illicit ships lurking in the bay: spy stations, arms dealers, offshore hospitals, money-laundering operations, drug factories and torture centers.

She was by nature a placid bird, slow to take wing and hard to rile, but the pigeon had been presuming on her good nature for several months now, scooting between her and the pieces of bread that people tossed in her direction as they wandered by, fluttering down to snatch treats of fish almost from her beak.<br> &nbsp;<br> This morning, the pelican had had enough, and when the pigeon came between her and a bit of tuna, she had just opened to the fullest extent and engulfed the fish fragment and the pigeon both, to squawks of outrage and alarm from her antagonist. To the Sergeant&#x2019;s eye, her swollen gullet had possessed at that moment the dreamy smugness of a trick well played, but he acknowledged inwardly that the faces of birds were impenetrable, so it could as well have been the foreknowledge of indigestion.<br> &nbsp;<br> The boy had been very impressed, which is to say that&#x2014;contrary to established practice&#x2014;he put down the comic book he was reading on the wall beside him and stared, his attention entirely taken up by the drama unfolding. The Sergeant had never seen him do this before. Even last year, when the volcano had briefly erupted and ash and fire had been falling all around, and the Sergeant had scooped him up under one arm and run like hell for the shelter of a convenient cellar, the boy had retained a desperate grip on Planetary no. 7, and clamped his other hand to the elderly Nokia cellphone which he kept in his left hip pocket.<br> &nbsp;<br> These items were the only evidence that someone else cared for him. The phone kept working and every so often he had a new comic, worn about the edges but with all its pages, and rarely more than three months out of date. Sometimes he carried a knapsack which contained several at once, when the supply had been irregular and he&#x2019;d been hoarding two or three while waiting for the previous issue, so as not to have things happen out of order. He was very particular about continuity, he had told the Sergeant in so many words. Events should happen in their proper time.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Otherwise the story will not work,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Totally bogus narrative structure. WTF?&#x201d; He actually spoke the letters &#x201c;WTF,&#x201d; and rolled his eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was just how it was. The boy&#x2019;s English was self-taught and uneven, peppered with guest appearances from movies and TV, from online games whose players were in America, Europe and China. When he spoke he could shift in one moment from the manner of a too-serious Harvard freshman to that of a teenaged Shanghai gold- farmer sweating in a vast warehouse of machines.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the topic of stories and character, he was particularly donnish and sniffy: &#x201c;There must be development-over-time or it is just noise.&#x201d; And when it appeared that the Sergeant was not entirely following this line of discussion&#x2014;it was one of their earlier conversations and the older man&#x2019;s education in these matters was not yet properly begun&#x2014;he had changed tack and demanded whether the Sergeant might have any lightweight twine that would work for a kite string. Which he had, and had happily given up.<br> &nbsp;<br> The pigeon&#x2019;s head disappeared, and the noises of protest from the pelican&#x2019;s throat began to fade. The boy picked up the comic again and read with his usual intensity. The Sergeant leaned back against the stone in such a way as to suggest that the affair had been nothing special, though in all honesty he&#x2019;d never seen anything to compare with it.<br> &nbsp;<br> They were an unlikely twosome. The man was of medium height and craggy. He was still six months shy of forty, but he looked fatigued and even a little lost. His face was leathered by a life of actual soldiering in inclement places, and he had scars, about which he was self-conscious. Scars were supposed to be narrow white lines which looked raffish, not puckered worms slithering forever across your shoulder and itching abominably. They should be discreet, so that a man could boast about them to girls. He was thickset&#x2014;and some of that was this recent bout of soft living, he had to concede, even if the rest was working heft&#x2014;but he seemed to move carefully, as if the world was fragile and he didn&#x2019;t want to break it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The boy meanwhile was androgynous in the way of boys, with no fat on his body at all, and scruffy black hair cut short. He seemed to be interested in everything, had a restless intelligence which might even qualify as genius. The Sergeant guessed his age as between ten and fourteen, but could not narrow the range. There was dust on him always, and often grass stains or splashes of oil. His forearms were corded with child&#x2019;s muscle from whatever work it was that he did&#x2014;and it seemed he did a bit of everything&#x2014;when he wasn&#x2019;t reading comic books and spending time with his friend. He wore a long smock which was rather too big on his shoulders, so that on a bad day he looked like a match-stick man in a lampshade. In the late- afternoon light and under the cracked fa�ade of the mission house, he resembled a monk, and the Sergeant expected him at any moment to lift his head and preach from the Book of Superman. Chapter 9, verse 21: the world shall know thee as a blur and as a sign upon the heavens, as a hope and an earnest of good things.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the boy had finished reading, he looked up to assure him- self that nothing of importance was taking place with the pelican, and then glanced over at the Sergeant. It was the hour of the day when they usually went to Shola&#x2019;s and took tea. The island of Mancreu had very few customs left, but tea had somehow clung on, and of all the caf�s and bars&#x2014;and as far as these two were concerned the remaining living rooms and campsites and samovars as well&#x2014; Shola&#x2019;s made the best tea. Shola had a proper kettle and he didn&#x2019;t leave the dregs in the pot or the scale in the water. He was a dandy and a gambler, but he knew tea.<br> &nbsp;<br> The sergeant had left his car at the fish market, ten<br> minutes away along the seafront. This was also customary. Walking along the front allowed him to say hello to everyone. The afternoon greeting was important for social order. Like tea, a British sergeant taking his ease along the promenade was a solid, familiar thing. It said that there was still sense in the world. In theory, of course, the British presence here had been withdrawn three years ago, claims of sovereignty having been yielded to the NATO and Allied Protection Force on Mancreu, NatProMan. The Sergeant was technically the senior officer (albeit non-commissioned) in the United Kingdom&#x2019;s Mancreu Command, and as a side job he was a senior consular staff member, too. &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t issue any bloody passports without checking the rules,&#x201d; the actual Consul had told him as he left, &#x201c;and for Christ&#x2019;s sake don&#x2019;t let anyone talk you into signing any treaties.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Could I?&#x201d; the Sergeant asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; the Consul said. &#x201c;But you could make a frightful mess, so don&#x2019;t. Take the keys, enjoy the house, and rest up. I understand that&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re here. Just nod to everyone and don&#x2019;t annoy Kershaw at NatProMan and this&#x2019;ll all be done in a few months. They can&#x2019;t keep the place around much longer. It&#x2019;ll be nice for you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Saying hello, therefore, was the greater part of the Sergeant&#x2019;s official function. He was to keep the consulate open and ensure that assistance was forthcoming to any British citizens who needed it, though this essentially meant calling the British Embassy in Yemen, and in any case had never actually been required. In many ways his real job was simply to occupy Brighton House, the sprawling, haunted old manse on a hill overlooking Beauville&#x2014;the only town of any size on the island&#x2014;which had in former times been the seat of colonial power. With its back to the mountains and the jungle, and its pocked face to the sea, Brighton House was almost identical to every British holding in the various candle ends of Empire&#x2014;even if perhaps the coming destruction of the island did make it dolefully unique.<br> &nbsp;<br> And so these were his days, week in and week out, and had been for more than two years: walk, take tea, and say hello. As the inheritor of what remained of British authority, he could additionally marry anyone who for some unlikely reason wanted him to officiate rather than a local priest, and he could facilitate adoptions and divorces for EU passport holders. Other than that, he could if he chose investigate local crime at the behest of a relevant person (it was unclear who was relevant so he tended to interpret this according to his lights) and he had the right to sit in on NatProMan Strategic Board meetings as representative of the United Kingdom&#x2014;which had chosen firmly to abrogate such representation and therefore he was under orders not to.<br> &nbsp;<br> Seen on the map, the island of mancreu was a double<br> arc, the shape of a seagull sketched by a child. The central segment, the beak, was thirty miles deep, the wingspan perhaps a hundred. Along the concave edges, mountains reared out of the restive water of the Arabian Sea. Mancreu was a first-and-last isle perched on the lip of the great mid-ocean ridge, midway between Socotra and the Chagos Islands. The people were an unbothered ethnic jumble of Arab and African and Asian, with the inevitable admixture of Europeans. France and Britain had held Mancreu alternately for centuries, with the French coming off considerably better, until late in the Victorian period it fell almost by accident under the Union Flag once more, and British it had remained thereafter, far flung and men- tioned mostly in the footnotes.<br> &nbsp;<br> To the north, the water grew pale green and warm. To the south, it turned blue, the bottom falling away into a frigid darkness which was the site of the indigenous population&#x2019;s hell. The south coast was known to be peopled with demons: fish-finned men and feral women ruled by Jack the Wrecker, Mancreu&#x2019;s resident fairy king. Bad Jack was capricious. If the milk turned, Jack had molested the cow. If you left honey on the doorstep, Jack might trade it for cash or rum or even a hunting rifle. He was known to rescue lost travellers, but also to rob them, and if a ship went down in bad weather, well, no doubt Jack had stood on the cliff with his lantern and seen it onto the rocks for spite. He was, in other words, the warm-water image of every bogeyman up and down the British coast, and likewise an object of knowing derision until the night drew in, after which people were discreetly more circumspect. Bad Jack, Mauvais Jacques, Jack Storm-eye&#x2014;and even, by some strange twist, Jack of the Nine, the bitter memory of a colonial governor&#x2019;s justice.<br> &nbsp;<br> The name, Mancreu, had been given by mariners grateful for the sandy beaches on the lee side. Those early sailors thought the island was an image of the Grail carved into the face of the Earth. On embroidered pieces of canvas cloth, sometimes crude, some- times alarmingly intricate and ethereal, they showed Mancreu as the curved palms of the Virgin catching the blood of Christ. In Beauville, this perception was still a matter of known fact. Elsewhere in the world it was less well understood, but from time to time a ship out of North Africa would put in, crewed by tyro seamen from missionary towns baked dry and starving, and somewhere near the bow would be a benediction in French:<br> &nbsp;<br> Hail, Madonna of the Gull&#x2019;s Wing. Hail, Madonna. Let your mark be upon us sinners, and your voice upon the deep. Bid the blue water roll softly. Speak to the clouds and hold their thunder. Guard us from men of ill-intent and from plagues and sorrows. Hail, Madonna. Hear us, Madonna. Bring us home.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was still a scrivener&#x2019;s office on the harbour front, where a holy sign-painter hung his papal warrant. He was an albino&#x2014; or something like it&#x2014;named Raoul. He was subject to strange in- firmities, either in consequence of his condition or from overuse of magic inks, but was said in person to be magnetic, like a poet or a prophet. He was also said to have been a mercenary, a leader of men, or perhaps a great pirate before the calling found him and the writing of God&#x2019;s word on ships became his life. The Sergeant had never ventured into his lair. It was his experience that one did poorly by involving oneself in matters of local religion. The world looked one way if you believed, and another if you did not, and that was all there was to it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The scrivener&#x2019;s beautiful daughter was famous around Beauville, and famously out of bounds. White Raoul&#x2019;s girl: what might the father do, should her heart be broken? Or worse: should harm befall her? What might he not do? Take down his sign, for sure, and close his shop&#x2014;but what else? Might he not write maledictions with the same strength as blessings? Or call upon whatever armies he once commanded to avenge her tears? Might not the papal warrant, conferred in the name of mercy, give equal prominence in God&#x2019;s eyes to a father&#x2019;s rage? Beautiful Sandrine must live a lonely life, uncourted and unkissed, because it was not known where Raoul&#x2019;s disapprovals might begin. The Sergeant had never seen her. He wondered some- times if she were a myth, a sort of running joke on the big foreigner. More likely he&#x2019;d walked past her a dozen times and not realised it, and her beauty was more to be found in its own fame than in her face.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tea,&#x201d; the boy said firmly.</p><h2>Human Energy Systems: A Way of Good Health, Using Our Auric Fields - Including Special Eye Exercises, a Tarot System and Guide to Medicinal Herbs</h2><p>Using auric fields to fine-tune health.</p><p></p><h2>The Seductive Impostor</h2><p><b>The first in a dazzling duo of romances featuring two sisters from the ruggedly beautiful Maine coast...and the men who sweep them away.</b> <br> Rachel Foster wishes Sub Rosa -- the seaside mansion she helped her father build and the scene of a terrible tragedy -- would crumble into the sea.

The author of the hugely popular Highlander time-travel series, she also wrote numerous contemporary romances.<b>Chapter Three</b> <p> Rachel sighed in relief when the last tumbler dropped into place with gentle precision. She spun the giant lock and pulled open the huge titanium door, revealing the darkness beyond. Warm, climate-controlled air rushed past her as she stepped inside and trained the beam of her flashlight around the interior. </p><p> Nearly as large as her kitchen at home, the huge vault was organized with shelves and cubbies and smaller safes against two of the walls. On the other two walls sheet-draped artwork was hung. Every square inch of space had been utilized and was brimming with treasure. </p><p> Rachel wasn't impressed. She slid the heavy pack off her shoulders and set it on the floor. She opened the buckles and pulled out the bronze statue, then used her flashlight to hunt for an inconspicuous place to set it. </p><p> It didn't belong here with the legitimate art collection, but since she didn't know where Thadd's secret room was, this vault would have to do. Better the contraband eventually be discovered in Thadd's possession instead of hers and Willow's. It would be Keenan Oakes's problem then. The man couldn't very well expect to waltz into a billion-dollar estate without having a few surprises to deal with. </p><p> That thought perversely warmed Rachel's heart. Keenan Oakes owned Sub Rosa now, and his great-uncle's legacy was going to rear up and bite him on his butt. </p><p> Rachel set the statue in one of the cubbies, then pulled the small painting out of her pack and unwrapped it from the towel she'd used to protect it for the trip here. She pushed the sheets on the far wall aside until she found a space large enough to hang it. She returned to the pack and pulled out the silver tankard, wine cup, and snuffbox next, and gently set them in another cubby beside a vase that looked as old as the earth itself. She pulled the ruby and gold ring her father had given her out of her pocket, set the beam of her flashlight on it one last time, then reached up and dropped it inside the wine cup, flinching at the sound of metal falling on metal. </p><p> With a sigh of regret for having given up her father's gift, she turned and dug into the bottom of the nearly empty pack again and pulled out the emeralds. </p><p> Rachel clamped her tiny flashlight between her teeth and aimed it at the smaller, sequentially numbered safes. Holding the wrinkled paper next to the lock on safe number sixteen, she moved the dial to match another set of numbers written in black ink. Just as they had on the larger door, the tumblers fell with expected accuracy. The small door opened, and Rachel sighed again in relief. </p><p> "Thank you, Daddy, for thinking of everything," she whispered into the darkness. Frank Foster had thoughtfully given her a laundry list of the art she now possessed, along with a list of combinations and codes. He hadn't, however, given her the exact location of Thadd's secret room. </p><p> And she had to find it. The letter had also mentioned designs for fishing boats that had been built at the Lakeman Boatyard years ago. Special boats, with hidden compartments for smuggling stolen art into the country. </p><p> Designs that likely had Frank Foster's name on them. </p><p> Rachel wanted them destroyed. She wanted every last trace of her father's involvement in Thadd's illegal hobby gone. </p><p> Rachel shone her light into the small safe and was surprised to see a velvet bag already sitting there. She opened the velvet sack she had brought with her and dumped the contents into her hand. The beam of her light immediately shot out in glowing green ribbons going in a dozen directions. </p><p> She reached into the safe and pulled out the second velvet sack and opened it, only to find an exact duplicate set of emeralds. </p><p> Well, hell. What did this mean? </p><p> They were obviously forgeries. Thadd must have had copies made of the original emeralds. But what were they doing here, in this safe? Surely the lawyers had inventoried this vault shortly after Thadd's death and would have found them. </p><p> And they would have known they were stolen, wouldn't they? Wasn't there a database somewhere that listed stolen and unrecovered art? Surely these emeralds would have been on it. </p><p> Unless the appraisers had realized these were fakes. It wasn't a crime, was it, to possess copies of stolen jewelry? </p><p> Rachel shrugged. She would just leave the real ones with the fakes, and they, too, would become Keenan Oakes's problem. </p><p> She used the velvet bag to wipe off any fingerprints on Willow's emeralds, put them back in their bag, and was just placing them in the small safe when every overhead light in the vault suddenly snapped on. </p><p> Rachel dropped the other velvet pouch and watched, dismayed, as the fake emeralds tumbled out. She tried but failed to catch them, banging her forehead into the small safe door, slamming it shut with a resounding click. Everything clattered to the floor, including her flashlight and the cane that had been hooked over her arm. </p><p> Rachel whirled toward the vault door and saw that several lights in the library had also come on. The raised voice of a woman echoed from somewhere below, carrying up the grand staircase and along the marble hall toward her. </p><p> Rachel bent to her good knee and searched for the fallen fake emeralds, scooping them up and hastily stuffing them into the remaining velvet sack. </p><p> She stopped then and glared at the closed safe door. </p><p> Dammit. She had to get out of here. </p><p> The voice of the woman grew louder, along with the tap of heels on the marble floor. Whoever she was railing at was upstairs now and coming toward the library. </p><p> Rachel shoved the pouch of forgeries in her pocket, quickly deciding that one set of emeralds was enough to leave behind. She would get rid of the fakes later, and pray it would be years before anyone noticed the emeralds in safe number sixteen were actually real. </p><p> She grabbed her pack, cane, and flashlight, and ran limping from the vault, stopping only long enough to close the huge door and spin the lock. She pushed the bookcase closed, concealing the vault. </p><p> Rachel looked toward the hearth on the far side of the room and decided it was out of reach of her crippled knee. She ducked into the storage closet instead, just as the library door swung open. </p><p> "I don't care, Kee," the woman shrilled on the other side of the closet door. "You promised we would go to the Renoir party. Then you suddenly decide you just have to come to this godforsaken monstrosity instead. It's freezing in here." </p><p> "Jason found the electrical box," the man said softly. </p><p> Rachel scrunched herself against the back wall of the closet, unable to suppress a shiver. The man's voice had been low, curt, and thin on patience. But the shrew didn't seem to hear what Rachel could: the quiet building of tension, the ominous calm before the storm. </p><p> No, the fool continued railing at the man who could be none other than Mr. Keenan Oakes. Dammit. He wasn't supposed to arrive until Friday. </p><p> "I don't know what all the hurry was for," the woman continued. "There's nobody here. You said this place has been empty for three years. Another week wouldn't have mattered." </p><p> Rachel silently nodded agreement. </p><p> "This might be some grand mansion you've inherited, but it's at the end of nowhere, Kee." Her voice dripped with distaste. "Maine! What in hell is there to do in Maine! It's a two-hour drive to the nearest airport. And this place is filthy. You should have hired someone to come open the house first, and that way we could have arrived <i>after</i> the Renoir party." </p><p> Rachel pictured the woman waving her hands about the giant library at the dark honey oak bookcases that reached twelve feet high, the heavy, oversized furniture covered with sheets, and the dusty tomes lining three of the walls. </p><p> Keenan Oakes still had nothing to say. Rachel decided he either had the patience of a saint or was deaf. </p><p> Rachel closed her eyes and covered her ears. A lover's quarrel was not supposed to be a spectator sport. </p><p> The woman suddenly snorted. "But this cold, moldering pile of rocks suits your Neanderthal brain perfectly, doesn't it?" </p><p> Rachel tried to decide whether the lady was brave or stupid. She wasn't sure she could take much more of this waiting. She was cramped, uncomfortable, and she agreed with the woman -- the house was cold. Her right knee throbbed and she ached all over. And she was using every bit of willpower she possessed to keep from sneezing out the dust collecting in her nose. </p><p> With the abruptness of a runaway train hitting a mountain, the woman suddenly stopped shouting. "What did you say?" she shrilled. </p><p> "I said that was enough, Joan. I told you to wait and come later with Mikaela." </p><p> "But I've been planning for us to attend this party for weeks. You said we would go." </p><p> "Then go." </p><p> "But you're supposed to go with me. All my friends are expecting the two of us." </p><p> Joan's voice had lowered to a simper now. Rachel pictured her pouting at Keenan, who stood as tall as a giant and had shoulders as wide as a doorway. Keenan Oakes now had more money than God and looks the devil would envy, if his picture in the newspaper could be believed. </p><p> He also had a very stupid girlfriend. </p><p> "I said that was enough, Joan. You'll have to go to Monte Carlo alone. Mikaela's due to arrive in a few days, and I intend to be here to meet her." </p><p> "Mikaela. It's always Mikaela. Your boat's got a whole crew of babysitters, Kee. She won't miss you for the time it will take to fly to Monte Carlo and back. What's one more week?" </p><p> Silence was all Rachel heard for an answer. </p><p> "Kee!" </p><p> "I asked the driver who brought us here to wait. He'll take you back to the airport," came his softly spoken words through the closet door. "And Joan?" </p><p> "Yes?" she asked, her voice suddenly sounding hesitant for the first time. </p><p> "Don't bother coming back." </p><p> Just for a minute, Rachel almost felt sorry for Joan. But only a minute. Any woman who couldn't handle a demigod didn't deserve one. Rachel thought Keenan Oakes was letting the shrew off lightly. Most men wouldn't be so kind for the assault his ego had just received. </p><p>...</p></p><h2>Insights on Revelation (Swindoll&#39;s New Testament Insights)</h2><p>The Engaging the New Testament Series by Dr. Charles R.

Whether it is one of her best-selling novels or a short story, Maeve shows us that times may have changed, but people often remain the same: they fall in love, sometimes unsuitably; they have hopes and dreams; they have deep, long-standing friends whose secrets are shared; they go on holidays and celebrate new jobs . . . <br> <i><br>A Few of the Girls</i> is a glorious collection of the very best of her short story writing, stories that were written over the decades&#x2014;some published in magazines, others for friends as gifts, many for charity benefits. The stories are all filled with the signature warmth and humor that have always been an essential part of Maeve&#x2019;s appeal.</p><p><b>MAEVE BINCHY</b>&nbsp;was born in County Dublin and educated at the Holy Child convent in Killiney and at University College, Dublin. After a spell as a teacher she joined <i>The</i> <i>Irish Times.</i> Her first novel, <i>Light a Penny Candle, </i>was published in 1982, and she went on to write more than twenty books, all of them best sellers. Several have been adapted for film and television, most notably <i>Circle of Friends </i>and <i>Tara Road, </i>which was an Oprah&#x2019;s Book Club selection. She was married to the writer and broadcaster Gordon Snell for thirty-five years, and died in 2012 at the age of seventy-two.<br><br>www.maevebinchy.comThe Bargain<br> &nbsp;<br> When Cara met Jim at a party the rest of the world seemed to dis�appear; they stood looking at each other with delight and listening to each other in fascination, as if they were old friends.<br> When the evening was over, they knew they would meet again and everyone else knew as well.<br> So they met the following day for lunch, and that turned into a walk beside the canal, and they spent so long over a cup of coffee that the waitress had to ask them to order another one or leave.<br> They were both aged twenty-eight, they loved travel and jazz and cooking and dogs.<br> His mother had died three years ago. Her father had died at the same time.<br> Jim knew the fellow who was giving the party because he had been on the same hurling team as him, way back when they were kids.<br> Cara knew him because he was a driving instructor and he had helped her to get her test.<br> Cara was a short story writer. She had gone to the party to cel�ebrate having finished her latest collection of stories.<br> Jim sold agricultural machinery. He had come to Dublin to celebrate a big sale and his father making him a partner in the business. <br> Finally, they hit one problem.<br> Cara lived in Dublin. Jim lived two hundred miles away in the country.<br> He was going back home the following morning. So they talked nearly all night about what they would do and finally, exhausted, they agreed that Cara would make the journey to Jim&#x2019;s part of the world the next weekend.<br> They made a bargain.<br> If Cara hated it she was to say so. If she thought that she could manage to write her stories there, and that she wouldn&#x2019;t miss her Dublin life too much, then she would say that and they would get married as soon as possible.<br> That&#x2019;s how sure they were in less than forty-eight hours.<br> So they both waited nervously for Cara&#x2019;s visit.<br> It involved a train journey, followed by a bus trip. Jim was standing there waiting at the bus stop. Cara&#x2019;s heart leaped when she saw him look anxiously at the bus in case she might not be on board. She saw the smile light up his face. He was so generous and warm.<br> <i>Please </i>may this not be a desperate place, she prayed silently.<br> Jim couldn&#x2019;t leave his father and the business they had both built up. She knew that. And she would be the one who should move. She lived at home with her mother and a big family of broth�ers and sisters. Her younger sister would get Cara&#x2019;s bedroom. Life would go on without her. But Jim could not possibly leave home. His father and his four sisters depended on him to keep the busi�ness going.<br> Surely it couldn&#x2019;t be too bad a place? It had produced Jim, after all. But the countryside looked very wild and woolly as the bus had hurtled along. Frightening-looking goats, or sheep maybe, but probably goats. They had terrifying curvy horns. Small, rough fields divided by stone walls . . . It was very far from anywhere, anywhere normal. But she nailed a smile on her face and he held her in his arms for a long time.<br> &#x201c;I was afraid you might not come,&#x201d; he said. <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> They drove together down one of the four streets in the town and out into the countryside.<br> The house where Jim lived had old roses in the garden and sweet peas, and the grass had been freshly cut.<br> &#x201c;I did that this morning,&#x201d; Jim said. &#x201c;I was too excited to do anything else. They wouldn&#x2019;t let me near work in case I gave the machinery away.&#x201d;<br> His father was stooped over a stick, standing at the door to welcome them.<br> &#x201c;He told me that you were a lovely girl, Cara, and he didn&#x2019;t exaggerate,&#x201d; he said with a big, broad smile just like his son&#x2019;s.<br> Jim&#x2019;s sisters were in the kitchen, trying not to look too eager to examine her. The eldest one was Rose. The bossy one, Jim had said. She was married to a rich man about twenty miles away. A miserly man, Jim had said, who didn&#x2019;t like Rose wasting his earnings on things like hairdos and clothes. She was very forthright, he said, sometimes too forthright. Rose looked Cara up and down.<br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t often have visitors,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;but we&#x2019;ve prepared a room for you. It will be separate rooms, I&#x2019;m afraid. This is my father&#x2019;s house and we have standards.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad to hear it,&#x201d; Cara replied with spirit. &#x201c;It would have been extremely embarrassing if it had been otherwise. Jim and I don&#x2019;t know each other very well yet, and certainly not well enough to share a room.&#x201d;<br> The other girls giggled. And even Rose looked at her with some respect.<br> Cara had won that round.<br> Jim had said that he would build a house nearer to the town. He had the land already and she would help him choose what kind of house. They would have a big studio where Cara would write, a small office where Jim would do his accounts, and plenty of rooms for when the children came along. <br> Together they would plant herbs and vegetables and flowers.<br> She looked around the table as they sat down for a late lunch; a lunch in her honor, with a full turnout to inspect and welcome her. Would these be her closest friends and contacts from now on if she were to make this giant leap and live here?<br> Could she bear trying to keep Rose in her place and to encourage the awkward, shyer younger ones, who seemed hesitant of themselves and doubting that they had anything to say unless it was drawn out of them?<br> Would she become involved in the machinery that Jim and his father were buying and selling?<br> Would she find anything to write about in this empty landscape and the small town with the four streets, one church, seventeen shops, and five public houses?<br> It would be ridiculous to make a decision on the basis of one weekend.<br> And anyway, Jim would have to come and meet <i>her </i>family and get to know them too. They didn&#x2019;t need to rush things, did they?<br> Then she looked across the table at him, his face beaming with pride that she was there, and she knew that there was no point in hanging about. This really <i>was </i>the kind of man she had dreamed of and never met. What did it matter where they lived, really?<br> They would not let Cara help with the washing up. Cara noticed that Rose filled a container with leftover food. &#x201c;Waste not, want not,&#x201d; she said when she saw she was being observed.<br> &#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re so right. Very sensible,&#x201d; Cara said hastily.<br> The younger girls took her on a tour to show her everything: the hens and geese, the old donkey, the orchard and the cow in the far field.<br> They loved this place where they had grown up.<br> They also loved their big brother.<br> &#x201c;He never brought anyone home before,&#x201d; said one.<br> &#x201c;So we knew you were special,&#x201d; said another. <br> &#x201c;He talked about you all week,&#x201d; said the third.<br> Then Jim came and drove her into town. They walked around and he saluted almost everyone he met.<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have a drink,&#x201d; he said.<br> &#x201c;Which is your local?&#x201d; Cara asked.<br> &#x201c;In a place like this, with a job like mine, they&#x2019;re <i>all </i>my local,&#x201d; Jim said and he brought her into Ryan&#x2019;s.<br> He had obviously told everyone in the place about her. Cara realized that they were all expecting to meet her. She shook hands with a dozen people who all said to Jim that he had done well for himself up in Dublin. Amazing in the fumes of traffic and all the noise that he had managed to find such a lovely girl.<br> Then they went to Walsh&#x2019;s pub and the other three.<br> In every place they had heard she was coming and Cara began to get edgy, as if she was some kind of traveling exhibition instead of a girl down from Dublin for the weekend.<br> Jim had a lemonade in each place and so did Cara. She felt full of fizz and bubbles. Only the caf� and the garage to call on and then they could go home.<br> &#x201c;They all think you&#x2019;re wonderful,&#x201d; Jim said, &#x201c;and so do I.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She felt trapped and imprisoned by this marvelous man. She felt that it was all happening too quickly.<br> In a moment he would introduce her to the priest and they would set a day and then she would spend the rest of her life in this small, faraway place.<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too soon, Jim,&#x201d; she said, almost in tears. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re lovely. It&#x2019;s <i>all </i>lovely. But it&#x2019;s gathering too much speed, like something rolling downhill.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;We had a bargain,&#x201d; he said sadly. &#x201c;If you didn&#x2019;t like it you were to say so.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say yes or no in twenty minutes,&#x201d; Cara begged. <br> &#x201c;So it&#x2019;s no then . . .&#x201d; His face was lined with disappointment.<br> They drove back to Jim&#x2019;s home in silence. His father and the girls were waiting inside eagerly. Rose had gone home to her mean husband, taking a plastic box of supper. Cara realized she hadn&#x2019;t known any of these people a week ago and now she was expected to come and make her life with them.<br> It wasn&#x2019;t fair. She <i>had </i>to have time to get used to it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The supper wasn&#x2019;t as jolly as the lunch had been. Jim said nothing at all and one by one the others let their chatter die down.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you must be tired, Cara,&#x201d; Jim&#x2019;s father said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be needing an early night.&#x201d;<br> She looked at him gratefully.<br> &#x201c;It has been a long day. Wonderful. But it had a lot of people in it,&#x201d; she said, and there was a chorus of good nights.<br> Jim looked like a child who had lost his lollipop.<br> In her bedroom Cara sat wretched on the side of her bed. It had been such a mistake to have rushed across the country after so short a time, giving rise to expectations that couldn&#x2019;t be realized. Just as she was about to climb the stairs, Jim&#x2019;s father had given her a big folder.<br> &#x201c;You might like to read this, my dear,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my late wife&#x2019;s diary. She wrote it every day.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;But I can&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s too private. Too personal,&#x201d; Cara began.<br> &#x201c;No, she would have liked you to read it,&#x201d; he said.<br> So she began at the start, when Maria had first come to this place. She had marveled that anyone could live so far from the bustling city where she had been born and grew up. She could not believe that it was possible to be so far from the theater and art galleries. How could anyone look out at those stony fields and go along the narrow roads without losing part of their soul?<br> But as the pages went on, Maria began to love the place, to know the seasons, to go hunting for mushrooms, to finding sheep that had rolled over on their backs and couldn&#x2019;t get up again. Maria wrote on how she started a mobile library. She had learned to drive and took books and art books to faraway farms and villages. She got to know everyone who lived within miles around. She won�dered what she had been doing in a city of strangers, walking past people whose faces and life histories she did not know. And all through the story was a thread: even up to the very last weeks was her love for Mikey, Jim&#x2019;s father.<br> How she had been nervous of his certainty in the very start, how he was so sure she was the one for him and she feared it was a decision too quickly made.<br> She wrote on and on about Jim&#x2019;s birth and how proud she was of him and her hope that he might be like his father before him and find the right one before she died.<br> Cara didn&#x2019;t know what time it was. She looked out the window. The moon seemed high in the dark sky.<br> The orchard looked beautiful with the old trees casting curled shadows.<br> The old donkey was asleep, standing up with his head on the gate. Cara had read how Maria had rescued him from people who had been ill-treating him when he was just a foal or whatever you call a young donkey. He had never done any work, just given the children rides on his back for years.<br> Down in the farmyard the hens and geese were clucking con�tentedly behind the mesh doors that kept the beautiful red fox away from them.<br> Cara could not understand now why she had feared this place. It was very like home already . . . <br> She blessed her future father-in-law for giving her the diary. She wished she had met Jim earlier and she would have known her soon-to-be mother-in-law.<br> Yes, of course she would marry Jim. <br> She remembered counting the hours after she had said good-bye to him in Dublin last week.<br> Now she was counting the hours until morning when she could tell him that they should see the priest while they were at it. She was going to live here&#x2014;she might as well get married here.<br> After all, that&#x2019;s what Maria had done all those years ago, and she had never known a day&#x2019;s regret.</p><h2>Forrest Gump (Movie Tie in)</h2><p>The life of an endearing idiot savant is marked by encounters with some of the most famous figures of the twentieth century.

Broken by the brutality he suffered and committed in equal measure while behind bars, his work and his daughter are the only light in his solitary life. When he receives a card in the mail from the woman who admits she was paid to frame him those years ago, King realizes that he has no choice but to take his own case: figuring out who on the force wanted him disposed of--and why. <br> Running in parallel with King's own quest for justice is the case of a Black radical journalist accused of killing two on-duty police officers who had been abusing their badges to traffic in drugs and women within the city's poorest neighborhoods. <br> Joined by Melquarth Frost, a brilliant sociopath, our hero must beat dirty cops and dirtier bankers, craven lawyers, and above all keep his daughter far from the underworld in which he works.

She can be found at mercedeslackey.com.There is pleasure to be taken from novels of intrigue in which readers don't have to think at all, where their hands are held throughout the action and nothing is anything but what it seems. In Lackey and Dixon's second novel of the Gryphon trilogy (after The Black Gryphon), holdover heroes Skandranon, Amberdrake and Winterhart attempt to establish a political liaison with the Haighlei and their king, Shalaman, in order to to preserve the autonomy of the city of White Gryphon. But a series of grisly murders is perpetrated in ways such that Skan, a gryphon, becomes the chief suspect, thus jeopardizing their negotiations. Several twists and turns follow, but the characters are so pure of heart that they overlook the obvious, and too many improbabilities pile up. The authors maintain a frenetic narrative pace, despite the frequent bromidic asides ("often, one can be in love with who they think someone is"). But even as a page-turner, this novel is likely to leave readers suspecting that Lackey and Dixon are just biding their time, that maybe the third book of the trilogy will be something special. What they present here is a harmless confection, less fattening than an eclair and about as nutritious. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>James Joyce&#39;s Dublin: A Topographical Guide to the Dublin of Ulysses</h2><p>One of the most important literary works of the twentieth century, <i>Ulysses</i> is also one of the most realistic novels ever written.

Dying of boredom.</p><p>I was sitting in a white wicker chair under a spreading chestnut tree on a manicured lawn. Behind me the stately battlements of Kingsdowne Place, seat of the dukes of Eynsford, were reflected in the perfect mirror of the lake, its surface ruffled only by a pair of gliding swans. Before me was a tea table, groaning under tiers of cucumber and smoked salmon sandwiches, strawberries and cream, �clairs, Victoria sponges, petit fours and scones with clotted cream. It was about the most perfect afternoon one could wish for, one of those rare English summer days when the only sounds are the buzzing of bees among the roses, the clickety-clack of a distant lawn mower and the thwack of ball on bat at the cricket match down in the village.</p><p>I gave a long sigh. It should have been of contentment but actually it was one of boredom. I have a confession to make. Being almost royal isn&#x2019;t always a piece of cake. For one thing it isn&#x2019;t always easy keeping that stiff upper lip in the face of royal relatives, lunatic suitors, and dead bodies. And it&#x2019;s certainly not easy doing nothing all day. I know that ordinary people who have to catch the eight-twenty to Waterloo every day envy our leisure but frankly most of the time our lives are a battle against boredom. I&#x2019;d love to be doing something useful. I&#x2019;d love to be making money too. But alas there are no jobs for a young woman whose education has only equipped her to walk around with a book on her head and know where to seat a bishop at a dinner party. My royal relatives would certainly not have been amused if they learned I was working behind the counter in Woolworths or serving tea at Lyons. And in this horrid depression even people with strings of qualifications can&#x2019;t find gainful employment.</p><p>What I should have been doing was my duty by marrying some half-batty Continental princeling, thus ensuring the continuation of some outmoded dynasty (while running the risk of being assassinated by anarchists). So far I had managed to avoid all half-lunatic princes that had been thrust in my direction. And in case you think I was against the idea of marriage, actually I did have a candidate for marriage lined up, but he, like me, was penniless with no prospects. A pretty hopeless situation.</p><p>And so I did what other young ladies of my station do until they find a husband&#x2014;endured long empty days punctuated by meals, healthy walks through the countryside and occasional bursts of excitement in the form of hunts. And since the weather in England is usually bloody, even more days of sitting reading, doing jigsaw puzzles, writing letters and counting the hours until the next meal.</p><p>A few months ago I thought I had fallen on my feet for once when I was asked to educate the newly discovered heir to the Duke of Eynsford into the ways of polite society. Kingsdowne Place, seat of the dukes of Eynsford, was everything a stately home should be&#x2014;impressively opulent and elegant with gorgeous grounds, a stable full of fine horses, and meals that were a succession of extravagant courses. There was no hint at Kingsdowne Place that the rest of the world was in a depression. But my stay had not exactly gone according to plan. There had been plots and a murder, and when the dust had settled I had stayed on out of duty to give companionship to the dowager duchess. My nanny and governess were very hot on duty. I had had it rammed down my throat since I could toddle. Rannochs prized duty above diadems. (Actually I&#x2019;d have prized the diadems if I&#x2019;d owned any.) Did I mention that I am Lady Georgiana Rannoch, and cousin to His Majesty King George?</p><p>I confess that my task had been made more pleasant because Darcy O&#x2019;Mara, the man I hoped to marry one day, had stayed on with me. But Darcy never remained in one place for long. He was a true adventurer and was always off on strange missions to far-flung parts of the globe. Anyway, he had gone again, the younger members of the Eynsford clan had dispersed and I was left at a great house with a dowager duchess, her two half-dotty sisters and several dozen servants. I was longing for younger company and a change of scenery when my mother came to the rescue.</p><p>For those of you who don&#x2019;t know my mother, let me assure you that she is not the maternal type. But on that afternoon when I was having tea on the lawn with the three weird sisters the dowager duchess Edwina paused with her teacup raised on its way to her lips.</p><p>&#x201c;That sounds like a motorcar coming up the drive,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;How extraordinary. Whoever could it be?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We aren&#x2019;t expecting anybody, are we?&#x201d; her sister Princess Charlotte Orlovski asked, swiveling around in her seat so that she could get a better look at the drive. &#x201c;My spirit guide didn&#x2019;t warn me of a visitor.&#x201d; (The Princess Orlovski was heavily into spiritualism.)</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s about time we had company,&#x201d; the third sister, the naughty and poorly named Virginia chimed in. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been as dull as ditchwater since everybody left. I&#x2019;m sure poor young Georgiana is dying of boredom and frustration. I know I am.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, no, of course not,&#x201d; I said hastily and untruthfully.</p><p>The sound of an approaching motorcar grew louder. Edwina put down her teacup and picked up her lorgnette, peering through the trees as the black shape of a motorcar came into view. It was an open-topped sports car, low and sleek, and it was being driven rather fast. My heartbeat quickened as I watched it come closer. Could it possibly be Darcy, home from foreign missions and coming to sweep me away?</p><p>Then I realized that the driver was certainly not Darcy. It was a small person, hatless, with blonde hair that blew out in the breeze. It was only when the driver spotted us and the car screeched to a halt in a shower of gravel that I recognized who she was.</p><p>&#x201c;Who on earth?&#x201d; Edwina started to say.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my mother, Your Grace,&#x201d; I said as a trim little person in bright red slacks and a white halter top climbed out of the car. She was wearing big sunglasses that hid half her face, and her hair, in spite of having been windswept, now looked perfectly in place. She waved then came toward us, tottering on high platform espadrilles.</p><p>&#x201c;There you are, Georgie,&#x201d; she called in that voice that had delighted theatergoers across the world. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been looking all over for you. I telephoned Castle Rannoch but your brother didn&#x2019;t seem to know where you were. You weren&#x2019;t at the house in London where I left you a few months ago. I was quite despairing until I ran into your friend Belinda at Crockfords last night and she told me you were staying with the Eynsfords.&#x201d; She had reached us now, picking her way carefully across the lawn. She seemed to notice the three elderly ladies, all sitting and staring at her in her flamboyantly modern outfit, for the first time. &#x201c;How do you do,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Sorry to barge in on you like this.&#x201d;</p><p>I intervened hastily. &#x201c;Your Grace, may I introduce to you my mother, the former duchess of Rannoch.&#x201d; I thought it wise to give Mummy the only acceptable title she&#x2019;s ever had. I wasn&#x2019;t actually lying. She was a former duchess of Rannoch. It&#x2019;s just that since that time she had been a great many other things to a great many men. It was possible that the dowager duchess knew a lot of this, but as always her manners were impeccable.</p><p>&#x201c;How do you do,&#x201d; she said, extending a hand. &#x201c;Delighted to meet Georgiana&#x2019;s mother at last. Although I do believe we met many years ago when your dear Bertie was still alive. I was his mother&#x2019;s lady-in-waiting, you know. He was such a lovable little boy, such a sweet smile. So sad that he died too soon, just like my own sons. One should not have to outlive one&#x2019;s children.&#x201d;</p><p>My mother, presumably not having heard of the demise of the Eynsford sons, wisely said nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;Do sit down and have a cup of tea,&#x201d; Edwina said, motioning to the maid who was standing nearby to bring another cup. &#x201c;Of course you must have been missing your dear daughter. And if only you&#x2019;d let us know you were coming, we could have had a suitable room prepared for you.&#x201d; It was the nearest to a reproach that manners allowed.</p><p>&#x201c;Most kind, but I&#x2019;m not intending to stay,&#x201d; Mummy said, accepting the teacup and sinking into a wicker chair. &#x201c;I only came to collect Georgie.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To collect me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, darling. We&#x2019;re going on a trip together.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A trip? Where?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;America,&#x201d; she said as if this was no more startling than a shopping expedition to London.</p><p>&#x201c;America?&#x201d; I blurted out.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, darling, you know that big place with the skyscrapers and cowboys.&#x201d; She gave the elderly sisters an exasperated smile that her only child could be so dense. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you run along and get your maid to pack your things while I have tea with these delightful ladies.&#x201d; She was already helping herself to a cucumber sandwich.</p><p>&#x201c;But I can&#x2019;t just leave like this, Mummy. It wouldn&#x2019;t be right. Her Grace has been through a most difficult time. I can&#x2019;t walk out on her when she needs me.&#x201d; But even as I said the words a voice in my head was whispering, &#x201c;America! I&#x2019;m going to America with my mother!&#x201d;</p><p>Edwina reached across and patted my hand. &#x201c;You have been a wonderful comfort to me in my hour of need, Georgiana. Such a kind girl. But I wouldn&#x2019;t dream of preventing you from going away with your mama, especially not to America. Transatlantic crossings are delightful and a young thing like you needs to see life, not be cooped up here with three old women. Of course you must go.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course she must,&#x201d; Virginia echoed. &#x201c;New York, such an exciting city. And they say that cowboys are wonderfully virile. In fact I remember a thrilling episode with a saddle and a particularly large whip. . . .&#x201d;</p><p>Edwina cleared her throat. Virginia&#x2019;s sex life had probably even outdone that of my mother and she never minded recalling it in the most vivid detail.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better run up and pack, Georgiana,&#x201d; Edwina said, &#x201c;if your dear mama is really intent on leaving this evening. Are you sure you wouldn&#x2019;t like to stay the night and leave in the morning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Kind of you, Your Grace, but I&#x2019;m afraid not,&#x201d; Mummy said. &#x201c;We have secured passage on the Berengaria and she sails on Thursday from Southampton.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Berengaria.&#x201d; Virginia gave a sigh of envy. &#x201c;The ship of millionaires, they used to call it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Still do,&#x201d; Mummy said. &#x201c;Who else can afford to travel these days? Anyway, she sails on Thursday and there is so much to be done that I couldn&#x2019;t spare an extra minute. Do get a move on, darling.&#x201d; She glanced at the motorcar. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how we&#x2019;re going to fit in your maid and your trunk. Do you still have that ghastly girl who looks like a hippopotamus?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Queenie? Yes, I&#x2019;m afraid I do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll never fit into the backseat, darling, let alone with the luggage. Have her come up by train with your things. Brown&#x2019;s Hotel, of course. I wouldn&#x2019;t stay anywhere else.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, Brown&#x2019;s Hotel. Such fond memories.&#x201d; This time it was Princess Charlotte who gave her sisters a wistful look.</p><p>&#x201c;Off you go, then.&#x201d; Mummy clapped her gloveless hands impatiently.</p><p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re sure, Your Grace?&#x201d; I looked at Edwina.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t keep your mother waiting, Georgiana,&#x201d; Edwina said. &#x201c;We old ladies will carry on as we always have done.&#x201d;</p><p>I put down my teacup, and tried to rise gracefully from my deck chair. Unfortunately I stepped on my skirt so that my graceful ascent turned into a stumble that nearly caught the tea table. I righted myself and set off, red-faced, with as much dignity as I could still muster.</p><p>&#x201c;Typical Georgie. Always was a walking disaster area, I&#x2019;m afraid,&#x201d; I heard Mummy saying as I moved out of earshot. &#x201c;Has she wrecked your house yet?&#x201d;</p><p>Oh dear. I&#x2019;d actually done rather well until now with nothing broken and no elderly ladies knocked off their feet. But unfortunately she was right. I am rather accident-prone when I&#x2019;m flustered&#x2014;like the time I caught my heel in my train at my debutante presentation and was propelled rapidly toward Their Majesties instead of backing from the chamber.</p><p>There was no sign of Queenie when I entered my bedroom. I tugged on the bellpull and waited. No maid appeared. I tugged again and started taking items of clothing out of the wardrobe. After a few minutes there was a tap on the door and Edie, the head housemaid, came in.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you ring, my lady?&#x201d; She curtsied.</p><p>&#x201c;For my maid,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Have you seen her recently?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She was at tea,&#x201d; Edie said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I haven&#x2019;t seen her since.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then please have somebody find her. I need her right away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will, my lady.&#x201d; She bobbed a curtsy and took off.</p><p>Why couldn&#x2019;t I have a maid like that, I thought. Willing, efficient, a joy to be around . . . Of course I knew the answer. Because I couldn&#x2019;t afford to pay her. Queenie had one advantage. She worked for almost no money, knowing that no gentlewoman in her right mind would employ her. The situation suited both of us most of the time.</p><p>I had emptied the contents of the chest of drawers onto my bed when I heard sounds resembling a stampede of elephants coming up the hall toward me. Queenie burst through the door, red-faced and disheveled.</p><p>&#x201c;Bloody &#x2019;ell,&#x201d; she said, observing the large pile of clothing on the bed. &#x201c;What the devil&#x2019;s going on &#x2019;ere?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re leaving,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I need my trunk retrieved and my clothes packed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Leavin&#x2019;? What do you want to go and leave for?&#x201d; she demanded, hands on very ample hips. &#x201c;First decent food we&#x2019;ve had in months.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I see you&#x2019;ve taken full advantage of it,&#x201d; I replied, noticing that her uniform was now bursting at the seams. &#x201c;Where were you? I rang twice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I had three pieces of seedy cake at tea today and I felt a bit sleepy afterward so I just went up to my room to have a bit of a kip, and before you know it I was out like a light,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;So where are we going, then? Not back to that god-awful castle in Scotland.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Queenie, I&#x2019;ve pointed out to you before that you should not criticize your employer or your employer&#x2019;s family. You should be glad you have a job in these hard times.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I ain&#x2019;t got nothing against you, miss,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s her what lives at the castle in Scotland. The ruddy duchess. She don&#x2019;t like me, does she? She thinks I&#x2019;m too common.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you are. You&#x2019;ve seen how other lady&#x2019;s maids behave, haven&#x2019;t you? You haven&#x2019;t even learned to call me by my proper title yet.&#x201d;</p><p>She sighed. &#x201c;I know you should be &#x2018;my lady&#x2019; but that sounds awful toffee-nosed, if you ask me. And you&#x2019;re so nice and normal and friendly that you&#x2019;re more like an ordinary miss.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nevertheless, Queenie, society demands that an aristocrat should be addressed in the correct manner. My cousin Elizabeth is a friendly little girl but one still has to address her as &#x2018;Your Royal Highness.&#x2019; Now please get a move on. My mother is waiting.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your mum? We&#x2019;re going off with your mum? Oh, that&#x2019;s all right then. She&#x2019;ll make sure we eat properly. Where are we going? Back to London?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, we&#x2019;re going to America.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bloody &#x2019;ell,&#x201d; she said.</p><p><b>Chapter 2</b></p><p>AT BROWN&#x2019;S HOTEL, LONDON</p><p>JULY 9</p><p>An hour later Mummy and I were speeding through the Kentish lanes on our way to London. Queen...</p></p><h2>The Night Visitor (Shaman Mysteries)</h2><p>The world of Daisy Perika ia a realm of shadows, omens, and restless spirits. In tribal policeman Charlie Moon&#39;s world, good and evil manifest themselves in more explainable, human ways. Yet the irascible old Ute shaman and her huge, good-natured nephew inhabit the same hard and lonely Colorado country. And now the parched earth has yielded up the remains of a gargantuan prehistoric beast on the site of a failed dude ranch--a find of enormous scientific importance that is attracting the attention of a wide variety of inividuals, some eminent and seemingly scrupulous...other obviously neither. Moon is also curious about the strange old bones. For things this ancient and rare have been known to inspire malevolent deeds in the past, including avarice, lies...and murder. And all it takes is one mysterious disappearance and one very suspicious death to convince Charlie Moon that his greatest fears have just been realized.</p><p>James D. Doss, recently retired from the technical staff of Los Alamos National Laboratory, now spends most of his time in a small cabin above Taos -- writing mystery fiction. He also travels to the fascinating locations where his stories take place, often camping in remote areas to absorb the impression of an Anasazi ruin, a deep canyon, an arid mesa, or a Sun Dance. His Shaman series includes <em>The Shaman Sings</em>, <em>The Shaman Laughs</em>, <em>The Shaman's Bones</em>, <em>The Shaman's Game</em>, <em>The Night Visitor</em>, and <em>Grandmother Spider</em>. The unusual plots are a mix of high technology and mysticism (<em>Shaman Sings</em>), bizarre animal mutilations (<em>Shaman Laughs</em>), theft of a sacred artifact (<em>Shaman's Bones</em>), an unprecedented form of murder and revenge at the Sun Dance (<em>Shaman's Game</em>), a most peculiar haunting followed by the discovery of an astonishing fossil (<em>Night Visitor</em>), and -- because a small girl has killed a spider without performing the prescribed ritual -- the appearance of a monstrous, murderous, eight-legged creature on the reservation (<em>Grandmother Spider</em>, of course!).An old lady shaman, four backbiting paleontologists, a con man, two orphans, two cops and a ghost: from this grab bag of real and unreal Americans, Doss conjures up his fifth Shaman mystery, a quirky, satisfying follow-up to last year's The Shaman's Game. This time, Ute tribal cop Charlie Moon is asked to keep an eye on Horace Flye, an Arkansas rapscallion straight out of Mark Twain. Horace inexplicably has found employment with a team of paleontologists digging up Nathan McFain's ranch. Rumor has it that Nathan himself discovered a mammoth tusk with butcher marksApossible evidence of a human kill site dating back 31,000 years. Just as the feuding scientists consider publicizing their remarkable find, Horace disappears, leaving behind a bratty six-year-old daughter named Butter Flye. Moon brings Butter to his aunt Daisy Perika, an elderly shaman who has other worries, chiefly a mute, mud-caked, blue-eyed spirit holding an egg who has been loitering around her trailer in the dead of night. Once again, Doss dazzles with his trademark blend of Native-American folklore, science, satire and suspense. Sometimes there's too much of a good thing: vivid but extraneous minor characters muck up the action, and an extended subplot involving series regular Police Chief Scott Parris and his journalist girlfriend seems tacked on for old time's sake. But wry Officer Moon and irascible Daisy continue to charm as the series' lead characters. The dialogue crackles, and the Southern Colorado atmosphere astonishes, especially at night. Author tour.

One world war was over, more than 6 million soldiers had been killed, and four vast empires had been destroyed. A second mass slaughterin which more than 46 million would diewas yet to come, bringing in its wake the arms race, the Cold War, and the nuclear age.<p>This volume of Martin Gilberts three-volume narrative history of the century charts its first thirty-three years. Opening in the age of horse-drawn travel and colonial wars, Gilbert closes this volume with Roosevelt as the newly elected President of the United States, the inauguration of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany, and the first of Stalins show trials in the Soviet Union. As well as chronicling the wars, revolutions, and political upheavals, Gilbert tells the story of ordinary men and women in every continent, making them an integral part of the events of which they were sometimes the beneficiaries and often the victims.</p></p><p><p>Martin Gilbert is Winston Churchill's biographer and the author of eight acclaimed books on the Holocaust. He lives in London.</p>After writing more than 50 books, the eminent British historian, knighted in 1995, could be excused for feeling tired, and this first volume of his history of the 20th century shows it. One of the problems is that he has chosen to cover the period year by year, with the result that, like a butterfly, he alights briefly on one country before winging his way to the next. This tends to interrupt the flow of the narrative and the development of any themes. The only exception is where he describes the First World War, on which he has already written much, and where the inherent drama of the events imposes its own theme. Another problem lies in a lack of freshness in the writing: ``the ever-changing, ever-renewing drama on the world stage. . . . Everywhere mankind strove, and continues to strive for that better tomorrow.'' A further problem, most unexpected in a historian of Gilbert's accomplishment, is his use of sources. For example, although he describes it as a ``patriotic volume published annually,'' he quotes Cassell's Illustrated History of England at length and almost uncritically: ``Never was there a touch of nature that made the whole world more kin than the death of her Majesty the Queen of England.'' The First World War dominates the period, occupying a quarter of the book, but Gilbert gives little indication of why statesmen, with few exceptions (Churchill in England, Count Tisza in Austria-Hungary), were so blind to its potential consequences and why the peoples of Europe greeted the declaration of war with such enthusiasm. The good bits tend to suggest ``Trivial Pursuits'': In 1906, for example, Coca-Cola replaced the cocaine in its drink with caffeine, and Lindbergh's achievements finally convinced the American people that the airplane was safe. Churchill, whose biographer Gilbert is, would have called this volume a ``themeless pudding.'' (24 pages b&amp;w photos, not seen) (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Amid the fervor of the religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening, John Humphrey Noyes, a spirited but socially awkward young man, attracted a group of devoted followers with his fiery sermons about creating Jesus&#x2019; millennial kingdom here on Earth. Noyes established a revolutionary community in rural New York centered around achieving a life free of sin through God&#x2019;s grace, while also espousing equality of the sexes and &#x201c;complex marriage,&#x201d; a system of free love where sexual relations with multiple partners was encouraged. Noyes&#x2019;s belief in the perfectibility of human nature eventually inspired him to institute a program of eugenics, known as stirpiculture, that resulted in a new generation of Oneidans who, when the Community disbanded in 1880, sought to exorcise the ghost of their fathers&#x2019; disreputable sexual theories. Converted into a joint-stock company, Oneida Community, Limited, would go on to become one of the nation&#x2019;s leading manufacturers of silverware, and their brand a coveted mark of middle-class respectability in pre- and post-WWII America.</p><p>Told by a descendant of one of the Community&#x2019;s original families, Ellen Wayland-Smith's <i>Oneida </i>is a captivating story that straddles two centuries to reveal how a radical, free-love sect, turning its back on its own ideals, transformed into a purveyor of the white-picket-fence American dream.</p></p><p><b>Ellen Wayland-Smith </b>teaches in the Writing Program at the University of Southern California, and received her PhD. in Comparative Literature from Princeton University.

They were an irresistible pair to millions of fans all over the world, further underscored by the rousing &#x201c;yes, we can!&#x201d; gospel of their biggest hit, &#x201c;Love Will Keep Us Together.&#x201d; But underneath the image was an entirely different story that the fans never saw: a woman who fought a lonely struggle against the controlling and often bizarre behavior of her emotionally inaccessible husband. Toni Tennille: A Memoir is a visceral account of Toni Tennille&#x2019;s life from her childhood in the segregated South to her thrilling rise to fame in the world of pop music to where she is now: no longer one-half of a famed couple, but a stronger woman for all she has experienced&#x2014;both the good and the bad. Toni hopes that her story will help anyone who feels trapped in a toxic relationship realize that it is never too late to break away from it.</p><p>Toni Tennille is an icon of American music, having been part of the popular duo Captain and Tennille with her husband at the time, Daryl Dragon."Love Will Keep Us Together" is one of the last songs I wrote with Howie Greenfield in the early seventies. I'll never forget the day when I received a 45rpm in the mail of my song by a new group "The Captain and Tennille", which by the way, I could not pronounce correctly. I put it on the turntable and almost fell off my chair. It was the most perfect production and performance of a pop song that I had ever heard. <br><br>I marvel at what a great singer Toni Tennille truly is. Certainly in the league of Ella Fitzgerald and others from years before. Now, she has written a moving memoir filled with the strength and warmth she has always possessed. I will always have a special place in my heart for her as a person and for her as an artist." <br><br>- Neil Sedaka, legendary recording artist and songwriter.

Long passionate about the Civil War buff, she has studied theera avidly and has&nbsp;made many visits to Gettysburg,&nbsp; where she has witnessedreenactments of the legendary clash between North and South. Linda exploresthat turbulent time in <i>The Yankee Widow.</i><br><br>Scowling and warm behind the ears, Landry Sutton picked himself up off the hoof-hardened ground of Walker Parrish's main corral. Stubbornly setting his jaw and squaring his shoulders, he laid silent claim to his dignity and finally bent to retrieve what remained of his hat. The bronc, a gelding aptly named Pure Misery, had stomped it flat in the brief but hectic process of throwing him that third and&#x2014;for today&#x2014;final time.<br><br>Landry reckoned he should be glad his skull hadn't met the same fate as his headgear, but he couldn't quite make the philosophical shift from adrenaline-fused annoyance to gratitude. He was frustrated, embarrassed and pissed off&#x2014;and those were just the emotions he had <em>names</em> for.<br><br>Arrogance on four legs, the sweat-lathered horse took a few prancing turns around the corral, moving outward in ever-widening circles. He snorted once or twice, nostrils flared, neck bowed into a curve, head held high and proud, ears laid so far back they were almost flat against his hide.<br><br>Finally, the gelding came to a purposeful halt about a dozen yards away from Landry, hind legs planted firmly in the dirt, flanks quivering with a barely contained strength that seemed about to bust loose in a whole new way, like a primeval thunderstorm.<br><br><em>Go on, cowboy&#x2014;try it again.</em> That was the message.<br><br>Slowly, Landry became aware of their immediate surroundings, his and the horse's&#x2014;that son of Satan&#x2014;though most of what lay beyond their battleground was still a dust-roiled haze, a void with its own heartbeat. Landry did register the presence of his brother Zane perched on the top rail of the corral fence. He knew his sibling was looking on with charitable, even benign, interest, waiting to see what would happen next.<br><br>Was Landry fool enough to get back on that crazy cayuse, he might have been wondering, or would he finally see reason and call it a day?<br><br>"Anything broken?" Zane called, in a jocular drawl. He was only thirteen and a half months older than Landry, but the gap might have been wider by a decade, considering the dynamics between the two of them. Zane tended to come from the place of older-and-wiser, like a father, or a venerable uncle&#x2014;or a justice of the Supreme Court.<br><br>Stung anew, Landry merely glared in Zane's general direction for a few moments, then slapped his ruined hat against one thigh to vent some of the steam still building inside him. A handful of ranch workers&#x2014;all employed by Walker Parrish, local rodeo-stock contractor and older brother to Zane's wife, Brylee&#x2014;ducked their heads briefly, in half-assed attempts to hide their grins of enjoyment.<br><br>It was no big stretch to figure out what the other men were thinking, of course. After nearly a year in Montana, Landry was still an outsider, still that dandified greenhorn from Chicago, still the perennial dude. Still and always the great Zane Sutton's kid brother.<br><br>And not much more.<br><br>Six feet tall, smart as hell and a self-made man, an independently wealthy one no less, and a ranch owner in his own right, Landry normally didn't sweat the small stuff. The fact was, he'd never failed at anything he set out to do, in all his thirty-plus years of life, unless you counted his efforts to stay married to Susan Ingersoll without committing murder, that was. To him, the ill-fated marriage had been a disaster, yes, but he wouldn't have described it as an actual defeat. He and Susan never should have tied the knot in the first place, if only because they hadn't wanted the same things, even in the beginning.<br><br>Now, aching in every muscle, bones seeming as brittle as if he'd aged by twenty years since breakfast, his pride chafed raw as a sore with the scab ripped off too soon, Landry watched glumly as one of the ranch hands roped the bronc, led him out of the corral and turned him loose in the adjoining pasture.<br><br>Zane stood next to Landry now, there in the slowly settling dust. "Buy you a beer?" he said quietly. He started to raise one hand, as if to slap Landry on the back, perhaps in brotherly reassurance, but he must have thought better of the gesture in the end, because he refrained.<br><br>It was just a beer, and Landry wanted one badly, but his first impulse was to refuse the offer, all the same. He and Zane had been close as kids, and right up through their late twenties, but then, around the time their mom died...<br><br>Well, things had just gone to hell. Some kind of chasm had opened between the brothers, and there didn't seem to be a way across. For the most part, they'd gone their separate ways, Zane taking to the rodeo circuit and eventually winding up in the movies, of all things, while Landry headed for Chicago, a place that had always intrigued him. By going to night school and working days and weekends as a barista at one of the coffee franchises, he'd gotten his degree, taken a job with Ingersoll Investments, originally landing in the mail room. He'd climbed the corporate ladder and eventually met and married the boss's daughter, Susan.<br><br>Certain he'd found his niche at long last, Landry had pushed up his figurative sleeves and proceeded to make money&#x2014;a shitload of it&#x2014;for the company and, through bonuses and finally a partnership, for himself, as well.<br><br>"I wouldn't mind a beer right about now," Landry heard himself say, instead of the "No, thanks" instinct dictated. The more sensible thing would have been to take his sorry self straight home, of course, back to his half of Hangman's Bend. There, he could have tossed back a Scotch or two, gulped down some aspirin and maybe stood in a hot shower until his muscles stopped screaming.<br><br>So it was that they walked out of the corral together, Zane and Landry, passing through the gate, shutting it behind them. Zane waved a farewell to the others as he and Landry headed for his rig, a silver extended-cab truck so covered in dried mud that it might have been any color in the spectrum. Zane's adopted mutt, Slim, waited patiently in the bed of the pickup, panting in the bright June sunshine, perfectly content to be just what and where he was.<br><br>A person could learn a lot from a dog, Landry reflected silently. Stepping up onto the passenger-side running board, he paused long enough to pat the critter on the head and ruffle his floppy ears. "Hey, dog," he said, with gruff affection. "How ya doin'?"<br><br>Talk about your rhetorical question.<br><br>Slim wagged his tail, appreciative but, at the same time, taking the greeting as his just due, and then settled down for the short ride over to neighboring Hangman's Bend.<br><br>Without pausing, Zane climbed behind the wheel, pushed the ignition button and looked back over one shoulder, acknowledging the dog with a grin. He loved that goofball canine, no question about it, would have let him ride in the cab if the critter had shown any inclination to do so. Slim had recently developed a preference for the back, though, seemed to like riding with a pile of feed sacks and whatever else Zane happened to be hauling at the time, and he showed no signs of changing his mind anytime soon.<br><br>"You ought to get yourself a dog," Zane remarked, maneuvering the truck into a slow, wide turn. "They're real good company, you know."<br><br>His brother, the authority on loneliness, Landry thought, with an ironic inward sigh. As if Zane had ever suffered any lack of "company," even before he'd settled on the run-down, abandoned ranch outside Three Trees, Montana, the one he and Landry had bought together, sight unseen, a few years before. These days, Zane had his beautiful bride, Brylee, first and foremost. And then there was the formidable but ever-faithful Cleo, their housekeeper&#x2014;and Nash, Zane and Landry's half brother, a rowdy thirteen-year-old with a childhood behind him that made their hardscrabble upbringing look downright pampered.<br><br>"I'll get around to it," Landry allowed, still distracted by other thoughts. "Getting a dog, I mean." A pause, followed by an irritated "There's no hurry, is there?"<br><br>Zane didn't answer, and that was all right, because sometimes&#x2014;and this was one of them&#x2014;they didn't feel a need to talk. The rig bounced down the long, rutted driveway, dog and gear rattling in the back.<br><br>Walker's place, called Timber Creek, was a prosperous spread, to put it mildly, but the dirt trail leading to the main gate was in little better shape than a cow path after a month of pounding rain followed by a ten-year drought. Out here in the wilds of Montana, Landry had observed, folks weren't overly concerned with either convenience <em>or</em> appearances, whether they had two nickels to rub together or not. It probably wouldn't have occurred to most of them to smooth the way with a layer of asphalt. Sure, one or two showy types might have sprung for a load of gravel, if the bills were current and the price of beef was decent, he supposed, but nobody paved a driveway.<br><br>Nope, even ranchers as successful as Walker Parrish seemed content to cope with whatever conditions presented themselves&#x2014;waist-high snow in the winter, the sticky mud of spring, which the locals called "gumbo," or the deep, dry dirt furrows of summer and fall.<br><br>There were times, usually short-lived, when the lure of the place eluded Landry completely&#x2014;like now.<br><br>Still cheerfully pensive, Zane drove on. The living quarters on his share of Hangman's Bend Ranch were relatively modest, considering the size of his bank account. He'd been what amounted to a modern-day John Wayne before he suddenly decided to leave movie stardom behind for good, go back to the land and subsequently reinvent himself. Now he and Brylee shared a nicely renovated stone house, large and comfortable, but certainly nothing fancy, by Hollywood standards at least. The barn was sturdy and the old-fashioned garage was detached, with a dented aluminum door that had to be raised and lowered by hand. Neither a tennis court nor a swimming pool marred the landscape.<br><br>Brylee was weeding the vegetable garden when Zane and Landry drove in, her ever-present German shepherd, Snidely, supervising from the sidelines.<br><br>Zane's bride wore a floppy straw hat, her rich brown hair stuffed fetchingly up inside, a sleeveless blouse and denim jeans, frayed where she'd cut them off above the knees to make shorts. Brylee's long legs were sun-browned, like her arms, and her feet were probably muddy and probably bare.<br><br>Seeing the truck, she beamed like a war bride at the approach of an overdue troop train and came toward them, hurrying but graceful, moving between rows of corn and green beans and Bibb lettuce.<br><br>Watching Brylee, Landry felt a pang of something sharp and forlorn, bleaker than loneliness, but not quite qualifying as envy, while Zane jumped out of the rig, strode to meet his wife and, with a laugh, swept her right off her feet, swinging her around in a broad circle of celebration and then kissing her soundly.<br><br>Slim, like any good country dog, bounded down from the back of the truck and rushed toward his master and mistress, barking, delighted by the ruckus, making himself part of it.<br><br>Brylee had lost her hat by then, and her hair spilled down over her shoulders in glorious, coffee-colored spirals, threaded with gold. Belatedly noting Landry's presence, his sister-in-law blushed apricot-pink, a modern-day Eve just now coming to the realization that she and her Adam weren't blissfully alone in the Garden of Eden after all.<br><br>So much for a bout of lovemaking right there in the tall grass, Landry thought. He wouldn't have put it past them, if the circumstances were right. Wouldn't have blamed them for it, either.<br><br>He smiled a "hello" at Brylee, reached for his hat and remembered that he'd tossed it into the back of Zane's pickup, but the words in his head, surprisingly affable, were meant for his brother. <em>You lucky bastard.</em><br><br>"I promised this yahoo a beer," Zane announced, still grinning, cocking a thumb toward Landry to identify him as the yahoo in question. The taut air around the couple almost snapped, like a rubber band stretched beyond its limits, and then let go. "As you can see, the man's a little the worse for wear."<br><br>Although he was sure Zane hadn't meant anything by it, the remark reminded Landry with a wallop that he'd been thrown three times, that his clothes were stiff with dust and dried sweat and a combination of the two and that his boots were caked with manure. Plenty of good old-fashioned dirt had ground itself right into his hide, filling every pore, coating every hair on his head.<br><br>Again, it swamped him, that sense of selfconsciousness mingled with some indefinable loss, a factor he'd never had to cope with before the move to Montana.<br><br>"I'll be fine out here on the porch," he suggested, and instantly wished he'd kept his mouth shut, if only because the offer sounded so lame.<br><br>Brylee smiled warmly. Although she hadn't liked Landry when he first arrived in Parable County, she'd mellowed noticeably since last Christmas, when she and Zane had gotten married. "Don't worry about it," she responded, with a rueful glance at her own grimy feet. "This is a ranch, and dirt comes with the territory."<br><br>The screen door creaked just then, and Cleo&#x2014; Zane and Brylee's housekeeper&#x2014;trundled through the gap and out onto the porch, her skin a glistening ebony, her dark eyes flashing, her gray hair partially tamed by a bandanna scarf. She looked stern, but that was a pose, Landry suspected, the ruse of a tenderhearted person trying to hold on to a little personal space.<br><br>"Say what, Mrs. Sutton?" Cleo challenged, making it clear that she'd overheard Brylee's statement about ranches and the inevitability of dirt. "I just now finished mopping the kitchen floor&#x2014;it isn't even dry yet&#x2014;and I don't care <em>how</em> much dirt it takes to make up this ranch. You're <em>not</em> setting foot in my clean house until you hose those feet off good." In the next instant, Cleo's gaze moved over both Zane and Landry, sweeping them up into her good-natured consternation. "Same goes for the two of you. I don't work my fingers to the bone around this place for my health, you know. And a person's got to have standards!"<br><br>Zane, apparently used to being lectured, simply grinned and gave the woman an affable salute of acquiescence. The discourse sounded familiar to Landry, too&#x2014;he could easily imagine that warning coming from Highbridge, not quite so colorful, but with better enunciation and grammar.<br><br>Ah, Highbridge. Yet another reason Landry fit in around here about as well as an extra toe in a narrow-soled boot. He employed a butler. What self-respecting cowboy did that?<br><br>"You tell me what you want and I'll bring it out here," Cleo prattled on, hands on her hips, elbows jutting. By then, the hint of a grin had appeared in her eyes, and the corners of her mouth twitched slightly. Like Highbridge, she clearly relished stating her opinion, asked for or not.<br><br>"Beer," Zane replied lightly. "And make sure it's cold, if you don't mind."<br><br>Cleo narrowed her eyes, then fixed Brylee with a look. "Iced tea or lemonade for you," she informed her crisply. "If you're not pregnant, it's not for lack of effort, now, is it, and we both know alcohol is no good for babies."<br><br>Brylee shook her head, but her color was high again. <em>"Cleo,"</em> she scolded, laughing a little.<br><br></p><h2>Empire of Mud: The Secret History of Washington, DC</h2><p>Washington, DC, gleams with stately columns and neoclassical temples, a pulsing hub of political power and prowess. But for decades it was one of the worst excuses for a capital city the world had ever seen. Before America became a world power in the twentieth century, Washington City was an eyesore at best and a disgrace at worst. Unfilled swamps, filthy canals, and rutted horse trails littered its landscape. Political bosses hired hooligans and thugs to conduct the nation's affairs. Legendary madams entertained clients from all stations of society and politicians of every party. The police served and protected with the aid of bribes and protection money. Beneath pestilential air, the city&#x2019;s muddy roads led to a stumpy, half-finished obelisk to Washington here, a domeless Capitol Building there. Lining the streets stood boarding houses, tanneries, and slums. Deadly horse races gouged dusty streets, and opposing factions of volunteer firefighters battled one another like violent gangs rather than life-saving heroes. The city&#x2019;s turbulent history set a precedent for the dishonesty, corruption, and mismanagement that have led generations to look suspiciously on the various sin--both real and imagined--of Washington politicians. Empire of Mud unearths and untangles the roots of our capital&#x2019;s story and explores how the city was tainted from the outset, nearly stifled from becoming the proud citadel of the republic that George Washington and Pierre L'Enfant envisioned more than two centuries ago.<br></p><p><p><b>J.

Davis, Arizona State Univ., Tempe [<i>Library Journal</i>, Sept. 2014]<br><br>Make no mistake.&nbsp;"Empire of Mud,"&nbsp;J.D. Dickey's history of early Washington, is a bracing and graceful read, but upon finishing its calamity-laden pages, you may conclude that a lot of people had a lot of years to get a job done and failed to do it -- and that their failure haunts us in ways too numerous to count. So if you can stomach learning how our beautiful, vexed city became a cat toy for national politicians and an ongoing rebuke of democracy, this is as good a place as any to start.

In philosophy and literature, Kierkegaard ("By far the most profound thinker of the nineteenth century"�Ludwig Wittgenstein) is generally perceived as epitomizing existential angst. However, there is much more to Kierkegaard than the popular image of the �melancholy Dane� or the iconoclastic critic of established Christendom. Alongside the pseudonymous books for which he is largely known, Kierkegaard also wrote many devotional works, which he called "upbuilding" or "edifying" discourses. Taken as a whole, these writings offer something very different from the popular view�they embody a spirituality grounded in a firm sense of human life as a divine gift.</p></p><p><p>S�ren Kierkegaard (1813&#x2013;1855) lived in Copenhagen, Denmark. His books include <em>Works of Love</em> and <em>Spiritual Writings</em> (translated and edited by George Pattison).</p><br><br><p>George Pattison is a professor of theology at Oxford University.</p>Fascinating and perplexing in equal measure, these exegeses on gospel and biblical sayings display a side of the great 19th-century philosopher Kierkegaard (1813&#x2013;1855) that is considerably less familiar to modern readers than his status as a protoexistentialist. Editor Pattison (The Philosophy of Kierkegaard) offers 16 texts organized loosely around three themes--"Gift," "Creation," and "Love"--that show the philosopher at his most passionate and poetic, but also, a surprise in light of his radical theology, at his closest to the views of religious orthodoxy. Throughout, the author focuses on short pieces of scripture, interrogating their meaning psychologically. This allows for examination of a variety of everyday experiences from a Christian perspective, particularly doubt, difference, desire, anxiety, and silence. While the editor provides a useful introduction, his thematic style of selection and organization makes for a large degree of repetition. Despite such occasional tedium, Kierkegaard's lyricism, insight, and passionate insistence on the enduring value of scripture are frequently a wonder to behold. (Nov.) (c) <br>Copyright � PWxyz, LLC.

What has been called &#34;the revolutionary nature of the Impressionist enterprise&#34; emerged from political radicalism, belief in science and individualism, and a view of art true to modern life and to immediate visual perception. In all these respects, Impressionism initiated the radical tendencies of modern art. Today the revolutionary aims of Impressionist artists are generally overlooked. Impressionist art has been marketed more successfully than any other style: the price of Impressionist paintings surpasses that of the Old Masters, exhibitions draw blockbuster crowds, and books and mass reproductions are ubiquitous. In her perceptive new survey, Belinda Thomson challenges both sentimentalized and simplistic views of Impressionism. Drawing upon recently discovered documents--critical reviews and letters between artists, writers, and dealers--she illuminates the thinking and the personal lives of the artists themselves, examining the factors and experiences that allowed Impressionism to develop when it did. She investigates the family background of the Impressionists, the importance of the art market and collecting, and the influence of the critical reception to their exhibitions. 250 illustrations, 200 in color.</p><p>Belinda Thomsonhas written extensively on impressionism and post-impressionism.

Lowe discusses the contradictions whereby Asians have been included in the workplaces and markets of the U.S. nation-state, yet, through exclusion laws and bars from citizenship, have been distanced from the terrain of national culture.<br>Lowe argues that a national memory haunts the conception of Asian American, persisting beyond the repeal of individual laws and sustained by U.S. wars in Asia, in which the Asian is seen as the perpetual immigrant, as the &#x201c;foreigner-within.&#x201d; In <i>Immigrant Acts</i>, she argues that rather than attesting to the absorption of cultural difference into the universality of the national political sphere, the Asian immigrant&#x2014;at odds with the cultural, racial, and linguistic forms of the nation&#x2014;displaces the temporality of assimilation. Distance from the American national culture constitutes Asian American culture as an alternative site that produces cultural forms materially and aesthetically in contradiction with the institutions of citizenship and national identity. Rather than a sign of a &#x201c;failed&#x201d; integration of Asians into the American cultural sphere, this critique preserves and opens up different possibilities for political practice and coalition across racial and national borders.<br>In this uniquely interdisciplinary study, Lowe examines the historical, political, cultural, and aesthetic meanings of immigration in relation to Asian Americans. Extending the range of Asian American critique, <i>Immigrant Acts </i>will interest readers concerned with race and ethnicity in the United States, American cultures, immigration, and transnationalism.<br></p><p>&#34;&#34;Immigrant Acts&#34; is a compelling and persuasively written presentation of Asian American &#39;cultural production.&#39; It is both an exciting and instructive volume.&#34;--Barbara Harlow, The University of Texas at Austin<p>Lisa Lowe is Samuel Knight Professor of American Studies at Yale University, and is the author of <i>Critical Terrains: French and British Orientalisms</i> and coeditor (with David Lloyd) of <i>The Politics of Culture in the Shadow of Capital </i>(Duke University Press).</p></p><h2>Three Tales of My Father&#39;s Dragon</h2><p>The classic fantasy trilogy of Elmer Elevator and the flying baby dragon has delighted children and their parents for generations. Now, on the occasion of their fiftieth anniversary, Random House is proud to bring the three timeless tales together in one beautiful commemorative edition, complete with the original delightful illustrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Newbery Honor Book and an ALA Notable Book, <i>My Father's Dragon</i> is followed by <i>Elmer and the Dragon</i> ("rich, humorous, and thoroughly satisfying"*) and <i>The Dragons of Blueland</i> ("ingenious and plausible, the fantasy well-sustained"*).&nbsp;&nbsp;Each story stands alone, but read in succession, they are an unforgettable experience.*<i>Library Journal</i>, starred review&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>My Father's Dragon</i>--a favorite of young readers since the 1940s and a Newbery honor book--captures the nonsensical logic of childhood in an amusingly deadpan fashion. The story begins when Elmer Elevator (the narrator's father as a boy) runs away with an old alley cat to rescue a flying baby dragon being exploited on a faraway island. With the help of two dozen pink lollipops, rubber bands, chewing gum, and a fine-toothed comb, Elmer disarms the fiercest of beasts on Wild Island. The quirky, comical adventure ends with a heroic denouement: the freeing of the dragon. Abundant black-and-white lithographs by Ruth Chrisman Gannett (the author's stepmother) add an evocative, lighthearted mood to an already enchanting story. Author Ruth Stiles Gannett's stand-alone sequel, <i>Elmer and the Dragon</i>, and her third volume, <i>The Dragons of Blueland</i> both received starred reviews in <i>School Library Journal</i> and are as fresh and original as her first. <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i>"Delightfully logical nonsense, appealing characters and irrepressible humor." -<i>The New York Times</i><br></p><h2>The Mastermind: Drugs. Empire. Murder. Betrayal.</h2><p><b>The incredible true story of the decade-long quest to bring down Paul Le Roux&#x2014;the creator of a frighteningly powerful Internet-enabled cartel who merged the ruthlessness of a drug lord with the technological savvy of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur.</b><br><br><b><b>&#x201c;A tour de force of shoe-leather reporting&#x2014;undertaken, amid threats and menacing, at considerable personal risk.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times</i></b><br><br></b>It all started as an online prescription drug network, supplying hundreds of millions of dollars&#x2019; worth of painkillers to American customers. It would not stop there. Before long, the business had turned into a sprawling multinational conglomerate engaged in almost every conceivable aspect of criminal mayhem. Yachts carrying $100 million in cocaine. Safe houses in Hong Kong filled with gold bars. Shipments of methamphetamine from North Korea. Weapons deals with Iran. Mercenary armies in Somalia. Teams of hit men in the Philippines. Encryption programs so advanced that the government could not break them.<br><br> The man behind it all, pulling the strings from a laptop in Manila, was Paul Calder Le Roux&#x2014;a reclusive programmer turned criminal genius who could only exist in the networked world of the twenty-first century, and the kind of self-made crime boss that American law enforcement had never imagined.<br><br> For half a decade, DEA agents played a global game of cat-and-mouse with Le Roux as he left terror and chaos in his wake. Each time they came close, he would slip away. It would take relentless investigative work, and a shocking betrayal from within his organization, to catch him. And when he was finally caught, the story turned again, as Le Roux struck a deal to bring down his own organization and the people he had once employed.<br><br> Award-winning investigative journalist Evan Ratliff spent four years piecing together this intricate puzzle, chasing Le Roux&#x2019;s empire and his shadowy henchmen around the world, conducting hundreds of interviews and uncovering thousands of documents. The result is a riveting, unprecedented account of a crime boss built by and for the digital age.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Mastermind<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;<i>The Mastermind</i> is true crime at its most stark and vivid depiction.

His large white head is shaved close, and what hair remains has gone gray as he approaches 40. He has the look of a beach vacationer cleaned up for a dinner out, with an oversized blue polo shirt and a pair of long khaki cargo shorts. His outfit is out of keeping with the discussion he is about to conduct, with a man he believes to be the head of a Colombian drug cartel, and whom he refers to only as Pepe. <br><br> &#x201c;Very easy,&#x201d; replies Pepe. In a video recording of the meeting, Pepe is seated just off screen, on a matching couch. His disembodied voice speaks in flawless, if heavily accented, English. <br><br> &#x201c;Very few people, not too many eyes. It looks like the right place.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Trust me&#x2014;what&#x2019;s your name again?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Paul.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Paul, trust me, it&#x2019;s the right place. I&#x2019;ve been here already for quite a bit of time. And always, me and my organization, we pick places like this. First of all, for corruption. You can buy anything you want here. Anything. You just tell me what you need.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s safe here,&#x201d; Le Roux says, knowingly. &#x201c;If there&#x2019;s a problem here you can fix it. I understand this type of place.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Everything is easy here. Just hand to hand, boom boom boom you can see,&#x201d; Pepe says, laughing. &#x201c;Well, thanks to your guy here, now we are meeting.&#x201d; He gestures at a third man in the room, an employee of Le Roux&#x2019;s who goes by the name Jack Anderson. It was Jack who had made the initial connection between Le Roux and Pepe. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> The deal Jack has brokered was complex enough that, when I meet him years later, I need him to walk me through it several times. The Colombians, who dealt primarily in the cocaine produced in their own country, were looking to expand into methamphetamine, which they wanted to manufacture in Liberia and distribute to the U.S. in Europe. Le Roux, the head of his own international organization based in the Philippines and Brazil, would provide the necessarily materials to build the Colombians&#x2019; meth labs: precursor chemicals, formulas to cook them into meth, and a &#x201c;clean room&#x201d; in which to synthesize it all. And while they got up and running, he could give Pepe the meth itself&#x2014;he&#x2019;d already stockpiled a ton of his own&#x2014;in exchange for an equivalent amount of cocaine at market rates. <br><br> After months of back and forth, Jack had urged Le Roux to travel to Liberia and meet his new associate &#x201c;boss to boss&#x201d; to finalize the deal. Over the half-hour recording of the meeting, Jack&#x2019;s face never appears. <br><br>&#x201c;So where do you want to start?&#x201d; Pepe says. &#x201c;First of all, is the clean room.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s already shipped,&#x201d; says Le Roux. &#x201c;We already sent it to you this week. I will get the bill of lading and I will give it to my man here to give to your guys.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Ok. So it&#x2019;s on the boat now.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s on the boat, it&#x2019;s on the water. Also you have the designs we sent to you. If you have any problem assembling it, I&#x2019;ll send guys here to assemble it like that.&#x201d; He snaps his fingers. <br><br> &#x201c;We shouldn&#x2019;t have any. I got my guys here, my chemist. It&#x2019;s going to work.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;To compensate you for the delays, we will just, when we do business, we will give you back the money.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Paul, you don&#x2019;t have to compensate me for nothing.&#x201d; <br><br> Le Roux flicks his hand in the air. &#x201c;We feel bad it took so long.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;This is just business,&#x201d; Pepe says. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have to compensate, just doing business. This is about money.&#x201d;<br><br> Pepe walks through his cartel&#x2019;s plans for building up his operation in Liberia. He is ready to arrange a trade of his high-quality cocaine for Le Roux&#x2019;s finished methamphetamine, a sample of which Le Roux has shipped to him from his base in the Philippines. &#x201c;Let me ask you a question,&#x201d; Pepe says. <br><br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;You are not Filipino, why the Philippines?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Same reason you are in Liberia. Basically, as far as Asia goes, it&#x2019;s the best shit hole we can find, which gives us the ability to ship anywhere. It&#x2019;s a good position. For example we can ship to Hong Kong, we can ship to Japan, we can ship to Australia from there. And the prices are very good. I mean, for the product that you are manufacturing, in Australia it&#x2019;s around 150,000 dollars a kilo. If we move the other one, the one you want, to Japan, it&#x2019;s around 100,000 a kilo. It&#x2019;s the best position in Asia. And it&#x2019;s also a poor place. Not as bad as here, but we can still solve problems.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You are cooking your shit in the Philippines?,&#x201d; Pepe says. <br><br> &#x201c;Actually right now we manufacture in the Philippines and we also buy from the Chinese. We&#x2019;re getting it from North Korea. So the quality you saw was very high.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not just very high. That is awesome.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I was going to tell you that later on, but now that you talk about it: That stuff is fucking incredible.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That is manufactured by the North Koreans,&#x201d; Le Roux says. &#x201c;We get it from the Chinese, who get it from the North Koreans.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;So my product is going to be the same, the amount that I&#x2019;m going to buy from you?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;The same. Exactly the same.&#x201d; Le Roux nods. &#x201c;I know you want the high quality for your market.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Yeah because the product&#x2014;you know that one of the best customers and you probably know that, is the Americans.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Number one.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the number one. They are fucking&#x2014;they want everything over there. I don&#x2019;t know what the word is from Spanish. Consumistas? Consumists?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Consumers,&#x201d; Jack interjects, off camera. <br><br> &#x201c;Yeah they buy everything and they never stop,&#x201d; Le Roux says.<br><br> &#x201c;So everything that I ship is to America,&#x201d; Pepe says. &#x201c;Trust me, when I brought this, fucking everyone was asking me for it. Everyone.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;That stuff comes from the North Korean government, that&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s so good,&#x201d; Le Roux says. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t care, they have a building like this size just to make this stuff.&#x201d;<br><br> Le Roux and Pepe consider different payment possibilities. First they will trade the cocaine for meth. After that, Le Roux says that he will be happy to be paid in gold or diamonds. If they need to conduct bank transfers, he works primarily through China and Hong Kong, although he sounds a note of caution. &#x201c;We just had, in Hong Kong, 20 million dollars frozen. By bullshit. They don&#x2019;t need any excuse. Just be careful. It still works, but you need to be cautious. It becomes worse, because the American, he likes to control everything. And they are there, making a lot of trouble.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I say fuck Americans,&#x201d; Pepe says. &#x201c;Americans, like you say, they think that they can control everything, but they cannot. It&#x2019;s not impossible, but they cannot. We have to be very careful.&#x201d;<br><br> They discuss shipment methods, and how many kilos of each drug the other could move in a month. Le Roux owns ships picking up loads in South America and traveling to Asia, but he much prefers to work in Africa, territory he knows well. His customers are in Australia, Thailand, China. &#x201c;We are not touching the U.S. right now,&#x201d; he says. <br> &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Actually we move pills in the U.S..&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;What kind of pills?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oxycodone, hydrocodone, tramadol, phentermine,&#x201d; Le Roux says. &#x201c;These American fucks, they have an appetite for everything. They are like whores. They will just spend and spend and spend, they don&#x2019;t give a shit. They buy everything.&#x201d; Indeed, Paul Calder Le Roux has gotten rich, fabulously rich, by selling tens of millions of pills to Americans over the internet, for nearly a decade. But unlike Pepe&#x2019;s organization, Le Roux avoids shipping street drugs like meth to the States. &#x201c;It generates too much heat,&#x201d; he says.</p><h2>Preacher&#39;s Bloodbath (Preacher/First Mountain Man)</h2><p><b>The Greatest Western Writers Of The 21st Century</b><br><br><b>Preacher takes on the last of the Aztecs in his biggest, bloodiest showdown yet. . .</b><br><br>There are a million ways to die in the Rockies--and a million predators, natural or otherwise.

Written with clarity and a dazzling intellectual passion, it is both a seminal work of modern geology and a compelling precursor to Darwinism, exploring the evidence for radical changes in climate and geography across the ages and speculating on the progressive development of life. A profound influence on Darwin, <i>Principles of Geology</i> also captured the imagination of contemporaries such as Melville, Emerson, Tennyson and George Eliot, transforming science with its depiction of the powerful forces that shape the natural world.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>In 1830 the Scottish geologist Charles Lyell published a groundbreaking book that championed uniformitarianism, the belief that the changing features of the Earth&#39;s surface were produced by the consistent operation of physical, chemical, and biological processes over time. Lyell laid the foundations of evolutionary biology and profoundly influenced Charles Darwin.<b>Sir Charles Lyell </b>(1797-1875) was a British geologist most famous for his great geological opus: <i>The Principles of Geology: Being an Attempt to Explain the Former Changes of the Earth's Surface, by Reference to Causes now in Operation</i> (3 vols 1830-33).</p><h2>Common Sense Business for Kids</h2><p>What does it take to be successful in business? Anthony Maybury used to think that in order to be successful in business one must know how to put complex theories into practice. He thought that success required knowledge of advanced mathematics, inventory management equations, and whiz-bang marketing techniques. But, he made some interesting discoveries. He came to realize that the greatest contributor to his business success was found in life experiences, not textbooks. Mr. Maybury said his business strategy was just "plain old common sense." But, through years observing others in the business world, he realized that his common sense business strategy was not so common after all. Through a series of interviews, author Kathryn Daniels collected dozens of Anthony Maybury's anecdotes and common sense strategies about what it takes to be successful in business. The result, "Common Sense Business for Kids," is a collaboration to benefit and encourage kids interested in entering the business world; but Maybury's wisdom is ageless. Using practical judgment derived from experience rather than study, and using real-world examples, Anthony Maybury explains common sense realities behind basic business principles, including: fixed and variable costs, market potential, research, price strategies, inventory management, salesmanship, and management techniques. Mr. Maybury discusses characteristics needed to be a successful entrepreneur, manager, or employee. Mr. Maybury comments: "I hope the 'common sense' I share with you will be beneficial as you embark on your own career, that it helps you appreciate the value in being aware, of looking at things from multiple perspectives, and of being ready to adapt. I hope you see that even though success in business may seem complicated, it's really just 'common sense.' " <br><br>Contents:<br>1. Business: It's All About Common Sense <br>2.

In his career, Mr. Maybury progressed from shoe-shine boy to a prestigious position as the General Manager of the West-Coast division for a major coffee company. His diverse experiences in the business world led him to amass a wealth of &#34;common sense&#34; to share with others. Mr. Maybury was so successful that he was able to take early retirement at the age of fifty-five.I have been searching for an economics course that would be suitable for middle school students. Much to my pleasure, I found exactly what I was looking for in "Business, Economics and Entrepreneurship for Middle School Students by Bluestocking Press!"<br><br>"Whatever Happened to Penny Candy?" was recommended to me over and over, which was what originally led me to the Bluestocking Press site. I was overjoyed to find an entire curriculum set for middle school students that included not only the book I was looking for, but three others!<br><br>"Whatever Happened to Penny Candy" is a simply written book of 15 chapters that helps students (and adults like me) understand the basics of the economics system in the United States. Not only that, but it incorporates history and current events in as well.<br><br>In real terms that aren t weighty and hard-to-grasp, your children will finish this book with more information than I was ever taught (even in college) about such things as wages, inflation, recessions, federal debt, and so much more. Even better, there s a common-sense sort of humor to the book that kept me chuckling all the way through.<br><br>"A Bluestocking Guide: Economics" is a sort of workbook/test book/extra study guide to go along with "Whatever Happened to Penny Candy." It includes extra articles to further study and understanding of each chapter in the "primer" (which is "Whatever Happened to Penny Candy"), as well as discussion questions and tests. The tests include everything from short answers and definitions to multiple choice and essay questions. Further reading lists, charts and diagrams are included, too.<br><br>You could read the primer without using this book, but it really helps round out the course.<br><br>"Common Sense Business for Kids" is 17 chapters, but only 62 pages of just what it says - common sense. Students learn the ins and outs of what it takes to successfully run a business - things like operating costs, markets, needs vs. wants, changing with the times, keeping inventory, employees and salesmanship.<br><br>Since each chapter is only a few pages, the info is not in depth, but instead very to-the-point. I find that extremely refreshing, and I have a feeling your kids will, too!<br><br>"Capitalism for Kids" is subtitled Growing Up to Be Your Own Boss. With a little more depth and a different range of topics, this book continues on the same theme as "Common Sense Business for Kids."<br><br>Chapters focus on such topics as evaluating what sort of business best suits the child s interests and talents, capitalism vs. communism and socialism, family businesses, investing time and money, gaining education and experience, and even such things and laws and licenses.<br><br>Again, I really like the common sense writing that isn t too wordy or philosophical. Quite simply it s written to kids for them to read themselves.<br><br>Even though this curriculum is suggested for middle school, I found it to be meaty enough for many high school students. However, if you re hoping to find a set put together specifically for high school, Bluestocking Press offers two.<br><br> 1. Economics Course for High School Students<br> 2. Economics and Nature of Government for High School Students<br><br>Both contain some of the same books that are in the middle school kit, so you will want to decide which age level you d most like to purchase and then purchase only that set. On the other hand, all of the books contained in the sets are available individually for those who would prefer to simply go through one or two books.<br><br>Loving this! --Cindy West, The Curriculum Choice</p><h2>Car Country: An Environmental History (Weyerhaeuser Environmental Books)</h2><p>For most people in the United States, going almost anywhere begins with reaching for the car keys. This is true, Christopher Wells argues, because the United States is Car Country&#x2015;a nation dominated by landscapes that are difficult, inconvenient, and often unsafe to navigate by those who are not sitting behind the wheel of a car.<br><br>The prevalence of car-dependent landscapes seems perfectly natural to us today, but it is, in fact, a relatively new historical development. In <i>Car Country</i>, Wells rejects the idea that the nation's automotive status quo can be explained as a simple byproduct of an ardent love affair with the automobile. Instead, he takes readers on a tour of the evolving American landscape, charting the ways that transportation policies and land-use practices have combined to reshape nearly every element of the built environment around the easy movement of automobiles. Wells untangles the complicated relationships between automobiles and the environment, allowing readers to see the everyday world in a completely new way. The result is a history that is essential for understanding American transportation and land-use issues today.</p><p><b>Christopher W. Wells</b> is associate professor of environmental history at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota.<p>[Car Country] is an excellent and needed addition to the still remarkably small literature that explores the combined histories of Americans, automobiles, and the environment.</p>--Tom McCarthy "The Michigan Historical Review "<br><br><p>One of the great strengths of the book is Wells's meticulous work in revealing how the institutional, economic, and mental arrangements supporting 'Car Country' were set in place during the interwar years. . . .

Yet nothing over the past century has had a greater effect on America's geography than the public's evolving dependence on the motor car, and, as well, the motor truck. . . . Christopher Wells's opus will excite more geographers to focus on automobility as a fundamental factor underlying the American experience.</p>-- (01/01/2014)<br><br><p>Wells has produced an important and persuasive new chapter in the history of American car culture.</p>-- (01/01/2013)<br><br><p>Wells argues that in order to understand how automobility has become so deeply 'locked in' to contemporary American society, historians and geographers would do better to focus on the built landscape . . .

Wells offers a compelling history of America's signature car-dependent landscapes.

It is prized for its pithy and pointed arguments that show that things lack intrinsic being and thus are &#x201c;empty&#x201d; (<i>shunya</i>). They abide in the Middle Way, free from the extremes of permanence and annihilation.</p><p>NAGARJUNA, the South Indian Buddhist master who lived some six hundred years after the Buddha, founded the Madhyamaka (Middle Way) school of Mahayana Buddhism. He is arguably the most important, influential, and widely studied Mahayana Buddhist philosopher."Anyone who is seriously interested in not suffering must know that duality and the dualistic mind are the root of all suffering. But how do we overcome duality without stepping on dualistic territory and without holding on to the hinges and railings of dualism? How do we develop the courage to shrug off even the understanding of nonduality by knowing that understanding to be just another figment of dualistic mind? This text is probably your best bet to prove just that!<br>It is so amazing that people like Nagarjuna actually walked on this earth. It is even more amazing that he came up with this text. If you don&#x2019;t read this book, it&#x2019;s like being on the earth without ever noticing that there is a sky above your head."&#x2014;Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse, author of&nbsp;<i>What Makes You Not a Buddhist<br></i><br>"Nagarjuna&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Mulamadhyamakakarika&nbsp;</i>is the foundation of the Mahayana&#x2019;s Middle Way teachings. All Madhyamaka schools have developed from this source, without which, teachings on the Mother Prajnaparamita would be impossible to fathom. Personally, this text opened my eyes to the Buddha&#x2019;s teachings on emptiness and has therefore benefited me greatly. With their understanding and training as a foundation, Padmakara has done an exceptional job with this translation. I am so glad that they have accomplished this formidable task, and I hope this edition serves as a great leap forward in the transplantation of the Buddhadharma in the West, especially in regard to the Middle Way teachings."&#x2014;Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche, author of&nbsp;<i>Light Comes Through</i></p><h2>The Veritas Conflict</h2><p>Claire Rivers races to the mailbox to receive a letter of acceptance to Harvard University while a heavenly battle rages.

The &#39;perfect storm&#39; is a once-in-a-hundred-years combination: a high pressure system from the Great Lakes, running into storm winds over an Atlantic island -- Sable Island -- and colliding with a weather system from the Caribbean: Hurricane Grace. This is the story of that storm, told through the accounts of individual fishing boats caught up in the maelstrom, their families waiting anxiously for news of their return, the rescue services scrambled to save them. It is the story of the old battle between the fisherman and the sea, between man and Nature, but here Nature is an awesome and capricious power that transforms the surface of the Atlantic into an impossible tumult of water walls and gaping voids, with the capacity to break an oil tanker in two, let alone the 72ft swordfishing boat Andrea Gail with her crew of eight. A typical Hurricane encompasses a million cubic miles of atmosphere and can contain enough energy to, in theory, meet the electric power needs of the UK for a decade. Except that a hurricane will not be controlled. In spare, lyrical prose &#39;The Perfect Storm&#39; describes what happened when the Andrea Gail looked into the wrathful face of the perfect storm.</p><p>Meteorologists called the storm that hit North America's eastern seaboard in October 1991 a "perfect storm" because of the rare combination of factors that created it. For everyone else, it was perfect hell. In <i>The Perfect Storm</i>, author Sebastian Junger conjures for the reader the meteorological conditions that created the "storm of the century" and the impact the storm had on many of the people caught in it. Chief among these are the six crew members of the swordfish boat the <i>Andrea Gail</i>, all of whom were lost 500 miles from home beneath roiling seas and high waves. Working from published material, radio dialogues, eyewitness accounts, and the experiences of people who have survived similar events, Junger attempts to re-create the last moments of the <i>Andrea Gail</i> as well as the perilous high-seas rescues of other victims of the storm. <p> Like a Greek drama, <i>The Perfect Storm</i> builds slowly and inexorably to its tragic climax.

Dittmer (History/DePauw Univ.; Black Georgia in the Progressive Era, 1900-1920, not reviewed) moves chronologically from WW II to 1968, mining a rich variety of sources to describe the numerous incremental battles in towns around the state. White Mississippi in the 1950s bolstered its ``siege mentality'' with harsh new laws blocking racial reform; while many in the black middle class were afraid to rock the boat, activists like the NAACP's Medgar Evers galvanized young people to wage sit-ins. Civil rights groups like CORE and SNCC joined in; organizers like SNCC's legendary Robert Parris Moses learned the importance of working closely with local communities. In 1962, the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) formed a united front of protest groups; its dual goals--quiet local grass-roots organizing and national publicity to gain federal protection--were, the author notes, contradictory. With the Kennedy administration sluggish on civil rights, COFO organized ``Freedom Summer,'' the 1964 education and voter registration project involving many white volunteers; Dittmer ably describes the project's successes and tensions. He also covers the historic efforts of the insurgent Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party at the 1964 Democratic presidential convention and the effects of the mechanization of cotton farming and the abortive War on Poverty. Dittmer concludes that the Mississippi movement, like other major American social movements, hit a cycle of compromise in which much political change was accomplished while fundamental economic change was deferred. Though some black activists attribute the movement's decline to the white influx during ``Freedom Summer,'' Dittmer suggests that rapid social changes nationally also weakened the movement's cohesion. More such analysis of larger issues would have been welcome, but the book's strength is in the details. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

For some he is a saint, for others the embodiment of human weakness, an archetypal politician willing to sacrifice one man for the sake of stability. In this dazzlingly conceived biography, a finalist for the Samuel Johnson Prize, Ann Wroe brings man and myth to life. Working from classical sources, she plunges us into the world of biblical Judaea under the reign of the erratic and licentious emperor Tiberius and lets us see the trial of Jesus, in all its confusion, from the point of view of his executioner.<br></p><p><i>Pontius Pilate</i>, by Ann Wroe, is beautifully written, imaginatively researched, and intricately structured. Most importantly, it provides readers with a valuable emotional experience: a chance to rediscover and redeem Pilate's famous question--"What is truth?"--in a spirit of humility and hope. A handful of small coins and one inscribed stone are the only physical evidence that Pilate existed. All of the textual sources that mention Pilate, Wroe notes, are "so wrapped in propaganda or agendas that it is difficult to detect what, if anything, may be true." But since Pilate "stands at the center of the Christian story and God's plan of redemption," Wroe persevered in her efforts to discern the profile of his life. "Without his climactic judgment of Jesus, the world would not have been saved. To have a faceless bureaucrat at the heart of all this drama was unacceptable: something had to be made of this man." The book's bold ambition, however, is not blind. "This is not a search for the 'real' Pilate," Wroe admits. "At best, all we have are glints and hypotheses." To learn about her subject, Wroe had to sacrifice most of her sympathetic impulses and shift her concentration to the elements of Roman life that she did not understand. And oddly enough, the passages in which Wroe describes her ignorance most clearly are where we begin to glimpse "a man actually walking on a marble floor in Caesarea, feeling his shoes pinch, clicking his fingers for a slave, while clouds of lasting infamy gather overhead.""Sublime...For a long time this book will remain the definitive study of Pilate."<br></p><h2>ARRL's Even More Wire Antenna Wire Classics Volume 3 &#x2013; More than 40 Antenna Designs for Any Application</h2><p>Even More Antennas to Build Even More Ideas to Experiment With<br>The third volume of the popular Wire Antenna Classics collection gathers the best antenna projects and innovative designs from QST, spanning over 10 years from 2002 through 2013.

Truman, whose presidency included momentous events from the atomic bombing of Japan to the outbreak of the Cold War and the Korean War, told by America&#x2019;s beloved and distinguished historian&#x2014;now available from Encore for a great value!<br><br>The life of Harry S. Truman is one of the greatest of American stories, filled with vivid characters&#x2014;Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Eleanor Roosevelt, Bess Wallace Truman, George Marshall, Joe McCarthy, and Dean Acheson&#x2014;and dramatic events. In this riveting biography, acclaimed historian David McCullough not only captures the man&#x2014;a more complex, informed, and determined man than ever before imagined&#x2014;but also the turbulent times in which he rose, boldly, to meet unprecedented challenges.<br> <br>The last president to serve as a living link between the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, Truman&#x2019;s story spans the raw world of the Missouri frontier, World War I, the powerful Pendergast machine of Kansas City, the legendary Whistle-Stop Campaign of 1948, and the decisions to drop the atomic bomb, confront Stalin at Potsdam, send troops to Korea, and fire General MacArthur.<br> <br>Drawing on archival material and extensive interviews with Truman&#x2019;s own family, friends, and Washington colleagues, McCullough tells the deeply moving story of the seemingly ordinary &#x201c;man from Missouri&#x201d; who was perhaps the most courageous president in our history.</p><p>This warm biography of Harry Truman is both an historical evaluation of his presidency and a paean to the man&#39;s rock-solid American values. Truman was a compromise candidate for vice president, almost an accidental president after Roosevelt&#39;s death 12 weeks into his fourth term. Truman&#39;s stunning come-from-behind victory in the 1948 election showed how his personal qualities of integrity and straightforwardness were appreciated by ordinary Americans, perhaps, as McCullough notes, because he was one himself. His presidency was dominated by enormously controversial issues: he dropped the atomic bomb on Japan, established anti-Communism as the bedrock of American foreign policy, and sent U.S. troops into the Korean War. In this winner of the 1993 Pulitzer Prize, McCullough argues that history has validated most of Truman&#39;s war-time and Cold War decisions.Hailed by critics as an American masterpiece, David McCullough's sweeping biography of Harry S. Truman has captured the heart of the nation. The life and times of the thirty-third President of the United States, <i>Truman </i>provides a deeply moving look at an extraordinary, singular American. From Truman's small-town, turn-of-the-century boyhood and his transforming experience in the face of war in 1918, to his political beginnings in the powerful Pendergast machine and his rapid rise to prominence in the U.S. Senate, McCullough shows, in colorful detail, a man of uncommon vitality and strength of character. Here too is a telling account of Truman's momentous decision to use the atomic bomb and the weighty responsibilities that he was forced to confront on the dawning of a new age. Distinguished historian and prize-winning author David McCullough tells one of the greatest of American stories in this stirring audio adaptation of his <i>Truman</i>---a compelling, classic portrait of a life that shaped history.</p><h2>Viking Raiders</h2><p>-- Takes readers back in time to illustrate the exciting happenings of daily life<p>-- Imaginary characters help recreate daily events</p></p><p></p><h2>Hmh Social Studies Sociology: Student Edition 2018</h2><p>HMH Social Studies Sociology: Student Edition 2018 by HOUGHTON MIFFLIN HARCOURT (Author) roduct details Series: HMH Social Studies Sociology Hardcover: 528 pages Publisher: HOUGHTON MIFFLIN HARCOURT; Student edition (January 1, 2017) Language: English ISBN-10: 0544859367 ISBN-13: 9780544859364 Package Dimensions: 11.2 x 8.8 x 1 inches</p><p></p><h2>The Consequences of Modernity</h2><p><p>In this major theoretical statement, the author offers a new and provocative interpretation of institutional transformations associated with modernity. What is modernity? The author suggests, "As a first approximation, let us simply say the following: 'modernity' refers to modes of social life or organization which emerged in Europe from about the seventeenth century onwards and which subsequently became more or less worldwide in their influence."</p><br><p>We do not as yet, the author argues, live in a post-modern world. The distinctive characteristics of our major social institutions in the closing years of the twentieth century suggest that, rather than entering into a period of post-modernity, we are moving into a period of "high modernity" in which the consequences of modernity are becoming more radicalized and universalized than before. A post-modern social universe may eventually come into being, but this as yet lies on the other side of the forms of social and cultural organization that currently dominate world history.</p><br><p>In developing a fresh characterization of the nature of modernity, the author concentrates on the themes of <i>security versus danger</i> and of <i>trust versus risk</i>. Modernity is a double-edged phenomenon. The development of modern social institutions has created vastly greater opportunities for human beings to enjoy a secure and rewarding existence than in any type of pre-modern system. But modernity also has a somber side that has become very important in the present century, such as the frequently degrading nature of modern industrial work, the growth of totalitarianism, the threat of environmental destruction, and the alarming development of military power and weaponry.</p><br><p>The book builds upon the author's previous theoretical writings and will be of great interest to those who have followed his work through the years. However, this book covers issues the author has not previously analyzed and extends the scope of his work into areas of pressing practical concern. </p></p><p>&#x201c;A highly general and speculative analysis of modernity that is challenging and thought-provoking. . . . This is the kind of book that confronts a discipline, in this case sociology, with a number of issues that can provide a formidable agenda for those who pursue them. . . .

When the chemicals diffusing in the primordial waters came together to form the first living cell, that was emergence. When the activities of the neurons in the brain result in mind, that too is emergence.<br> In <em>The Emergence of Everything</em>, one of the leading scientists involved in the study of complexity, Harold J. Morowitz, takes us on a sweeping tour of the universe, a tour with 28 stops, each one highlighting a particularly important moment of emergence. For instance, Morowitz illuminates the emergence of the stars, the birth of the elements and of the periodic table, and the appearance of solar systems and planets. We look at the emergence of living cells, animals, vertebrates, reptiles, and mammals, leading to the great apes and the appearance of humanity. He also examines tool making, the evolution of language, the invention of agriculture and technology, and the birth of cities. And as he offers these insights into the evolutionary unfolding of our universe, our solar system, and life itself, Morowitz also seeks out the nature of God in the emergent universe, the God posited by Spinoza, Bruno, and Einstein, a God Morowitz argues we can know through a study of the laws of nature. <br> Written by one of our wisest scientists, <em>The Emergence of Everything</em> offers a fascinating new way to look at the universe and the natural world, and it makes an important contribution to the dialogue between science and religion.<br></p><p><br><strong>Harold J. Morowitz</strong> is Clarence Robinson Professor of Biology and Natural Philosophy at George Mason University and the former Director of the Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study, in Fairfax, Virginia. A leading figure in the study of complexity, he was Editor-in-Chief of the journal <em>Complexity</em> and is co-chair of the science board of the Santa Fe Institute. His writing has appeared in <em>The New York Times, Discover, The Washington Post, The Sciences</em>, and <em>Psychology Today</em>.<br><br>"Morowitz claims that emergence supplies us with a new foundation for religion-one that enables the natural sciences to supply a foundation for spiritual realities." --<em> C.P. Goodman, The Polyani Society Periodical</em><p></p><br>"Closely reasoned and rich in scientific and philosophical background."--<em>Scientific American</em><p></p><br>"This is a brilliant book. Morowitz has provided the first state-of-the-art overview of the theory of emergence across the scientific disciplines. Neither too detailed nor too abstract, his 28 stages of emergence trace the history of the universe from the Big Bang through the appearance of culture, philosophy and spirituality. No other work has laid out the core case for emergence--and hence against the ultimacy of reductionism--across the whole spectrum of science. This introduction to emergence theory should guide philosophers of science and anthropologists, theologians and metaphysicians, as they reflect on the nature of Homo sapiens and our place in the cosmos."--Philip Clayton, Harvard University<p></p><br></p><h2>Plants in our World: Economic Botany:</h2><p>This one-semester text is designed for an upper level botany course. <i><b>Plants in our World</b></i> emphasizes how people use plants; including fundamental information on morphology, anatomy, and taxonomy as a foundation of general botany.

Christopher Boehm, an anthropologist whose fieldwork has focused on the political arrangements of human and nonhuman primate groups, postulates that egalitarianism is in effect a hierarchy in which the weak combine forces to dominate the strong.</p><p>The political flexibility of our species is formidable: we can be quite egalitarian, we can be quite despotic. <i>Hierarchy in the Forest</i> traces the roots of these contradictory traits in chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, and early human societies. Boehm looks at the loose group structures of hunter-gatherers, then at tribal segmentation, and finally at present-day governments to see how these conflicting tendencies are reflected.</p><p><i>Hierarchy in the Forest</i> claims new territory for biological anthropology and evolutionary biology by extending the domain of these sciences into a crucial aspect of human political and social behavior. This book will be a key document in the study of the evolutionary basis of genuine altruism.</p></p><p>Christopher Boehm is Professor of Anthropology and Director of the Jane Goodall Research Center at the University of Southern California.&#x201c;This well-written book, geared toward an audience with background in the behavioral and evolutionary sciences but accessible to a broad readership, raises two general questions: 'What is an egalitarian society?' and 'How have these societies evolved?'...[Christopher Boehm] takes the reader on a journey from the Arctic to the Americas, from Australia to Africa, in search of hunter-gatherer and tribal societies that emanate the egalitarian ethos--one that promotes generosity, altruism and sharing but forbids upstartism, aggression and egoism. Throughout this journey, Boehm tantalizes the reader with vivid anthropological accounts of ridicule, criticism, ostracism and even execution--prevalent tactics used by subordinates in egalitarian societies to level the social playing field...<i>Hierarchy in the Forest</i> is an interesting and thought-provoking book that is surely an important contribution to perspectives on human sociality and politics.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ryan Earley</b><b>, </b><b><i>American Scientist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Combing an exhaustive ethnographic survey of human societies from groups of hunter-gatherers to contemporary residents of the Balkans with a detailed analysis of the behavioral attributes of non-human primates (chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos), Boehm focuses on whether humans are hierarchical or egalitarian by nature...[Boehm's hypotheses] are invariably intriguing and well documented...He raises topics of wide interest and his book should get attention.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Boehm has been the first to look at egalitarianism with a cold, unromantic eye. He sees it as a victory over hierarchical tendencies, which are equally marked in our species. I would predict that his insightful examination will reverberate within anthropology and the social sciences as well as among biologists interested in the evolution of social systems.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Frans de Waal, Emory University</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Hierarchy in the Forest</i> is an original and stimulating contribution to thinking about the origins of egalitarianism. I personally find Boehm's ideas convincing, but whether one agrees with him or not, he has formulated his hypotheses in such a way that this book is likely to set the terms of the discussion for the forseeable future.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Barbara Smuts, University of Michigan</b><br><br>&#x201c;The most unique and interesting feature of this clear, well written book is the way Boehm links the study of nonhuman primates (particularly chimpanzees) to traditional concepts of political anthropology. As a political scientist, I was intrigued by Boehm's suggestion that democracy, both ancient and modern, could be understood as the expression of the same natural dispositions that support the egalitarianism of nomadic bands and sedentary tribes.

His ambition is to define the good policeman and to explain his development, but his achievement is to illuminate the philosophical and occupational maturation of patrol officers in 'Laconia' (a pseudonym) . . . .

She's fifty-three, a widow and an expert in her field. Her store does very well for a small town, and she is able to support two part time staff as well as other casual workers. Her husband Aaron had been a wealthy man but despite this she lives a simple life, causing speculation among the town's people. Margot's older sister, Betsy, comes to live with her. When Betsy was young she ran off to join the navy and married a sailor and now her second husband is divorcing her. Betsy seems to be planning to sponge off Margot, she sees living off Margot an easy solution to her problems, at least for the short term. In the idyllic world of Margot there are some problems. Her landlord wants her building so he can build something new and charge more, but Margot has a cheap lease that is good for another four years. So Joe sues Margot regularly and threatens her too, but she has a good lawyer to protect her. She also has a "Wanta be" successor who wants to run her own needlework store in a town that cannot support two. Irene is a little nuts and readily admits that she wants something to happen to Margot so that she can take over. Unfortunately for Irene she has no people skills and is not very successful with the customers. A few nights after her arrival, Betsy comes home and finds Crewel World trashed and Margot murdered. The mystery begins and Betsy takes it into her own hands when she thinks the police aren't doing enough. I LOVED THIS BOOK. Admittedly I am biased. I love to knit and cross-stitch and I love to read mysteries. This was the book written for me. Monica Ferris obviously knew what she was talking about too; she had the entire lingo down pat. But, you don't have to like these hobbies to enjoy this book. The characters are all strong and the plot develops well. The small town setting allows for colourful characters which Monica Ms. Ferris takes advantage of. Betsy is interesting as the sleuth, she is blunt and not very subtle and the character's reactions to her are amusing. I hope there are more books to come from Monica Ferris. Crewel World is one of the best books I have ever read! Monica Ferris has written a page turner! It's not often that a mystery is set in a cozy wool store, but she makes it work.

Wu&#x2019;s spiritual autobiography <i>Beyond East and West</i> was published in 1951, it became an instant Catholic best seller and was compared to Thomas Merton&#x2019;s <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i>, which had appeared four years earlier. It was also hailed as the new Confession of St. Augustine for its moving description of Wu&#x2019;s conversion in 1937 and early years as a Catholic. This new edition, including a foreward written by Wu&#x2019;s son John Wu, Jr., makes this profoundly beautiful book by one of the most influential Chinese lay Catholic intellectuals of the twentieth century available for a new generation of readers hungry for spiritual sustenance.<br><i>Beyond East and West</i> recounts the story of Wu&#x2019;s early life in Ningpo, China, his family and friendships, education and law career, drafting of the constitution of the Republic of China, translation of the Bible into classical Chinese in collaboration with Chinese president Chiang Kai-Shek, and his role as China&#x2019;s delegate to the Holy See. In passages of arresting beauty, the book reveals the development of his thought and the progress of his growth toward love of God, arriving through experience at the conclusion that the wisdom in all of China&#x2019;s traditions, especially Confucian thought, Taoism, and Buddhism, point to universal truths that come from, and are fulfilled in, Christ.<br>In <i>Beyond East and West</i>, Wu develops a synthesis between Catholicism and the ancient culture of the Orient. A sublime expression of faith, here is a book for anyone who seeks the peace of the spirit, a memorable book whose ideas will linger long after its pages are closed.</p><p>John C. H. Wu (1899&#x2013;1986) was a diplomat, scholar, and authority on international law. He wrote works in Chinese, English, French, and German on Christian spirituality, Chinese literature (including a translation of the <i>Tao Teh Ching</i>), and legal topics.

He maintained a correspondence with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., and later produced scholarly work examining Holmes's legal thought.&#x201c;Now in a new edition that includes a foreword written by Wu&#x2019;s son, John Wu, Jr., makes <i>Beyond East and West</i> a profoundly beautiful book by one of the most influential Chinese lay Catholic intellectuals of the twentieth century available for a new generation of readers hungry for spiritual sustenance.&#x201d; (<i>Midwest Book Review</i>)<br><br>"John C. H. Wu's <i>Beyond East and West</i> is truly among the great classics of Sino-Western and Sino-Christian writing. Scholars and general readers will rediscover the rich intellectual and spiritual reflections that only Wu can offer." (Anthony E. Clark, Edward B. Lindaman Endowed Chair, Whitworth University)<br><br>"John Wu's story of his conversion to Catholicism, although perhaps not as well known today, is rightly placed alongside the illustrious early to mid-twentieth century convert stories that we know so well: Thomas Merton, Dorothy Day, Karl Stern, Edith Stein, and others. This magnificent memoir is all the more remarkable because Dr. Wu brought his Chinese heritage into the Church to enrich her, rather than leaving it behind at the church door. Anyone interested in inculturation of the faith, Chinese Catholicism, profound and eloquent spiritual wisdom, or simply the dramatic story of a great soul, a learned scholar, and a husband and father (of thirteen children), will enjoy this book and profit from it greatly." (John Cavadini, University of Notre Dame)<br><br>"<i>Beyond East and West</i> is the beautiful story of the transformation of a prodigy scholar and well-respected lawyer into a devout Catholic intellectual through the spiritual harmonization of eastern and western philosophy and culture.

O&#39;Hanlon, accompanied by friend and poet James Fenton and three native guides brings wit and humor to a dangerous journey.</p><p>"Ye Gods, old man--don't do it!" you're bound to shriek on page 1 of this hilarious travelogue, on which the author lists the hazards that may befall him--vipers, cholera, crocs, ticks, tuberculosis, malaria, rabies, and 1,700 types of parasitic worms among them. After all, portly, over-the-hill <i>London Times</i> literary reviewer Redmond O'Hanlon hasn't done anything more aerobic than flip the pages of a book for decades; he wasn't even a Boy Scout. It's hardly reassuring that his colleague, poet James Fenton--who had the big idea to trek in Borneo--was a Boy Scout. He hated it, and besides, aged, balding Fenton, whom O'Hanlon describes as rather worm-like, sounds like he's a likely lunch for a swooping black eagle.<p> But on they trod--with the much-needed help of three Iban natives and an unseen, though oft-quoted river god--through jungle, across rivers whose height may rise seven feet overnight, and via native villages (where they often have late-night parties), with one goal in mind: seeing the fabled Borneo rhino. Fenton is nearly swept away in a whirlpool, they subsist on jungle-worm gruel, and ripping off sucking leeches is a near-daily occurrence, but cultural and natural insights and adventures abound in this rip-roaringly funny and deftly written travelogue that will have you chortling out loud. <i>--Melissa Rossi</i></p>A fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Society of Literature, <b>Redmond O'Hanlon </b>was the natural history editor of&nbsp;<i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>&nbsp;for fifteen years<i>.</i>&nbsp;He lives near Oxford, England, with his wife and their two children.

I&#x2019;m very fortunate to have the continuing support of real women affiliated with clubs, and like each of my books, this one has been reviewed for accuracy. <i>Reaper&#x2019;s Stand</i> was the first in which my club friends didn&#x2019;t find major errors regarding club life, so maybe I&#x2019;m finally figuring it out.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve tried to make each book in the Reapers Motorcycle Club series different, rather than following a set formula. This has challenged me as a writer, but I&#x2019;ve enjoyed exploring a variety of character types along the way. I think you&#x2019;ll find that <i>Reaper&#x2019;s Stand</i> has a different feel than the books that came before it. For example, <i>Devil&#x2019;s Game</i> was a coming-of-age novel. <i>Reaper&#x2019;s Stand</i> is the opposite&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a book about mature characters who are already fully formed as individuals. Every time I try something new, I worry that readers won&#x2019;t be willing to make the leap. So far you haven&#x2019;t given up on me. I hope you enjoy <i>Reaper&#x2019;s Stand</i>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>PROLOGUE</p><p>COEUR D&#x2019;ALENE, IDAHO<br>PRESENT DAY<br>LONDON</p><p>Should I look him in the eye when I killed him or just shoot him in the back?</p><p>Tough call.</p><p>I crouched in the kitchen, digging through my purse as if searching for keys. I knew right where the gun was, of course, but pulling it straight out just seemed so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. obscene. The smell of dinner on the stove filled my nose. Chicken chili, with whole-grain corn bread in the oven for a side because it&#x2019;s healthier.</p><p>It&#x2019;d been baking for ten minutes already, which meant I had about twelve more minutes to end his life before the bread burned.</p><p>Reese sat out in the dining room, reading one of his motorcycle magazines and drinking his favorite beer while he waited for food. I&#x2019;d been sure to buy a half rack earlier, and I&#x2019;d met him at the door with a cold one open and ready to go. He was on his second now. I wasn&#x2019;t under any illusions&#x2014;two beers wouldn&#x2019;t be enough to slow him down if he came after me, or ease his pain if my aim was off.</p><p>Still, a man deserves a beer before dying, right?</p><p>My fingers brushed the cold metal of the gun. I pulled out my phone instead and looked at Jessica&#x2019;s picture, studying her pretty, smiling face on graduation day. So full of hope and promise. She&#x2019;d raised her right arm to wave at the camera. Her pinkie curled forward, offering a glimpse of the sparkling tips on her new acrylics. She&#x2019;d wanted them for graduation so badly.

Her little sister died in the NICU two days after her birth. Never got a chance.</p><p><i>Fuck you, Amber. Fuck you very much for doing that to your kids.</i></p><p>I glanced up at the oven timer and realized I&#x2019;d wasted nearly three minutes thinking about Jess. I supposed I could kill him <i>after</i> pulling out the bread, but putting it off would just make things harder.</p><p>Or maybe I should feed him first?</p><p>No. He&#x2019;d had his beer, but if I had to sit across from Reese over a meal I&#x2019;d never make it. I couldn&#x2019;t look into those blue eyes and laugh. I&#x2019;d never been a good liar. This past month had been heaven and hell rolled into one big bad joke.</p><p>Right. Time for the punch line.</p><p>I pulled out the small pistol and stuck it into the pocket of the loose sweater I&#x2019;d picked so carefully for just this moment. I also took out my keys, my ID, and my cash, stuffing them into my jeans. Just in case. I didn&#x2019;t really expect to survive the night, but it never hurts to hope. The van was even gassed up and ready to go, on the off chance that I managed to get away.</p><p>Of course, I had no idea where I&#x2019;d drive. <i>Burn that bridge when you get to it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>Things started going wrong as soon as I walked into the dining room. Reese wasn&#x2019;t sitting at the head of the table, where I&#x2019;d left him. Damn. I could&#x2019;ve shot him in the back without warning if he&#x2019;d just stayed put. Now he sat facing me, leaning casually in his chair, beer in hand. The magazine lay open before him and he looked up, offering me that mocking smile of his. God, I loved that smile, despite the fact that it could be cruel as all fuck.</p><p>&#x201c;Something you want to talk about?&#x201d; he asked, cocking his head.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I murmured, wondering what he&#x2019;d say if I shared my thoughts. <i>Gee, Reese, I&#x2019;m so sorry I&#x2019;m about to kill you, but if it makes you feel any better I hate myself for doing it&#x2014;not a hundred percent sure I won&#x2019;t shoot myself next.</i></p><p>I wouldn&#x2019;t, though. Not yet. Not until I saw Jessica for myself, made sure they&#x2019;d kept their promises and she was safe and sound. After that?</p><p>Well. We&#x2019;d just have to see.</p><p>He sighed, eyes flicking to my pocket, where my hand shifted nervously on the gun.</p><p>Paranoia hit yet again.</p><p>He knew. He knew all about it, I could see it in his face. Fuck. I&#x2019;d failed her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>Don&#x2019;t be ridiculous. How could he possibly know?</i></p><p>&#x201c;Babe, you look like you could use a day off,&#x201d; he said finally. &#x201c;Have you considered hitting the spa? Maybe get a massage?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That costs too much,&#x201d; I said automatically, biting back a hysterical laugh. Because money mattered now, right?</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t suggesting that you pay for it,&#x201d; he said, frowning at me.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want your money&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I know, you&#x2019;re totally independent and you like it that way. Blah, blah. Just let me do something for you, for once. Fuck&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d;</p><p>Shit. Why did he have to be so nice?</p><p>I felt my eyes start to water and I looked away, forcing myself to detach again and focus. I needed to kill him, and I couldn&#x2019;t give him any warning. But he was facing me and all the way across the room, which was a bigger problem than it sounds. Pistols aren&#x2019;t exactly known for accuracy, and it&#x2019;s not like I had much in the way of experience.</p><p>I needed to get closer.</p><p>If I came up behind him, rubbed his shoulders&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That would be close enough. God, I was a shitty human being.</p><p>&#x201c;The food won&#x2019;t be ready for another ten minutes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You look sort of tense. Want a neck rub?&#x201d;</p><p>He raised a brow as I circled the table.</p><p>&#x201c;I think you should stay back,&#x201d; he said slowly. I paused.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;d hate to make it too easy for you, sweetheart.&#x201d;</p><p>My chest tightened. I offered a weak smile, because like I said&#x2014;I&#x2019;m a shit liar.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m assuming you&#x2019;re planning to shoot me in the back of the head,&#x201d; he said quietly, and that&#x2019;s when I realized he wasn&#x2019;t relaxed at all. He might be leaning back casually, but every one of those solid muscles roping his body had drawn tight, poised to attack. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a bad idea. You shoot that close, you&#x2019;ll be all covered in blood spatter. Means you&#x2019;ll have to risk tracking more evidence out of the house or taking time to clean up. Either way, complicates things.&#x201d;</p><p>Well. At least it was all finally out in the open. Almost a relief. I pulled out the gun and held it up, using my left hand to brace my right as I carefully sighted on him. I expected him to explode up at me, to fight back. Instead he just sat, waiting.</p><p>&#x201c;Go ahead, do it,&#x201d; he said, a sad smile toying with the corners of his mouth. &#x201c;Show me what you&#x2019;re made of.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry,&#x201d; I whispered. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never know how much I wish this weren&#x2019;t happening.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then <i>don&#x2019;t</i> do it. Whatever it is, we can work through it. I&#x2019;ll help you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>He sighed, then looked past me and jerked his chin.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s over, babe,&#x201d; I heard a man say from behind. Huh. I guess it was. Fortunately, I had just enough time to pull the trigger before he hit me.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>EIGHTEEN DAYS EARLIER<br>LONDON</p><p>My back was killing me.</p><p>It was nearly two in the morning, and I&#x2019;d just finished up the late-night cleaning shift at the pawn shop. I&#x2019;d been letting myself get soft the past couple of months. Too much time spent managing the business, not enough time scouring bathrooms, because I&#x2019;d forgotten just how much work scrubbing a toilet really is.</p><p>Well, scrubbing toilets, floors, dusting, vacuuming. London&#x2019;s Cleaning Service did it all, and while we might not be the cheapest crew in town, we were the best. I knew this because I turned down more accounts than I took these days. Thanks to my hard-earned reputation, finding new clients was easy. Workers? Not so much. Most people aren&#x2019;t fans of spending their nights wiping up after others, and even with my higher-than-average starting pay, people flaked on me.</p><p>Tonight, for example.</p><p>I&#x2019;d gotten a call from Anna&#x2014;one of my crew leads&#x2014;to say she had two no-shows. Because the life of a cleaning lady is nonstop glamour, that meant I got to spend my Friday evening scraping dried pee off the floor in a men&#x2019;s bathroom.</p><p>Charmed existence, I know.</p><p>At least my aching back and I could crawl into bed soon.</p><p>I pulled up to the house and noticed a blue Honda Civic parked in front. Mellie&#x2019;s car&#x2014;my young cousin&#x2019;s best friend. She must be spending the night with Jessie, I realized. I bit back the surge of annoyance. On the one hand, I really preferred it when Jess cleared stuff like this with me ahead of time.</p><p>On the other, there were worse things than having the girl home on a Friday. Most of them were worse, actually. God, I loved her so much, but Jessica was impossible. I reminded myself yet again that it wasn&#x2019;t entirely her fault&#x2014;the counselors told me over and over that I needed to help her learn to cope with her limitations, because it&#x2019;s not like she&#x2019;d grow out of them.</p><p>Decision making wasn&#x2019;t Jessica&#x2019;s strong suit.</p><p>According to the experts, that part of her brain just hadn&#x2019;t developed quite right, thanks to her mother&#x2019;s ongoing chemical romance. I wasn&#x2019;t sure how I felt about that. I knew she wasn&#x2019;t like other kids. But you know what? We all have to learn to get along in this world. Nobody&#x2019;s born with a clean slate, and she wasn&#x2019;t a little girl anymore.</p><p>I unlocked the front door to find Mellie sitting on the couch. Her knees were drawn up, her eyes were huge, and she clutched a can of Diet Coke like a shield.</p><p>My parent radar crackled to life.</p><p>&#x201c;What did she do now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We were at a party,&#x201d; Mel whispered. &#x201c;It was around ten o&#x2019;clock. She ran into some girls who graduated a couple years ago&#x2014;Terry Fratelli and her friends&#x2014;and they invited us out to the Armory for a party with the Reapers motorcycle club.&#x201d;</p><p>I swayed, grabbing the back of my old, green wing-backed chair to catch myself.</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck.&#x201d;</p><p>Mellie&#x2019;s eyes got even wider. I didn&#x2019;t cuss. She <i>knew</i> I didn&#x2019;t cuss. Ever.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the rest of it?&#x201d;</p><p>The girl looked away, biting her lip.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry for leaving her,&#x201d; she said, guilt written all over her face. &#x201c;But there was no way I&#x2019;d go out there and she didn&#x2019;t listen to me. She actually got kind of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Her voice trailed off and I filled in the gaps. Jessica liked to make fun of Mel when she wouldn&#x2019;t follow along like a well-trained puppy. Classic Jess. Such an idiot child&#x2014;I wasn&#x2019;t quite sure how she managed to keep a friend like Melanie around, given the shit she pulled.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway, she promised me she&#x2019;d text, and I told her I wouldn&#x2019;t say anything as long as she stayed in touch. But she stopped texting me around midnight and I could tell she was really drunk. Her messages weren&#x2019;t even making sense. I&#x2019;m really scared for her, London.&#x201d;</p><p>This last was said with a sniffle, and I realized the poor girl was terrified. I came over and sat down next to her, giving her a hug. Mel spent so much time over here that she felt like my own sometimes.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s gonna be so pissed I told you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You did the right thing, baby,&#x201d; I said, running a hand across her hair. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s being a selfish brat, putting you into this position.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, on the bright side she&#x2019;ll forgive me,&#x201d; Mel muttered. She sniffed and pulled back, looking up at me with a wavering smile. &#x201c;She always does.&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled back, but my thoughts were grim. Mel was too nice. Sometimes I wished she&#x2019;d ditch Jessie and find a new best friend. Then I felt guilty, because even with her issues, Jess was my heart.</p><p>&#x201c;I need to go find her,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Do you want to stay here or head home?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was thinking I could sleep here tonight?&#x201d; she asked. I nodded, already knowing the rest of the story. Friday nights at Mel&#x2019;s house weren&#x2019;t pretty, especially on paydays. Her dad liked to celebrate the end of the week a little too much.</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds good.&#x201d;</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>I tried calling Bolt Harrison from my van so Mellie wouldn&#x2019;t hear me. He managed Pawns, the same store I&#x2019;d been cleaning that night. It happened to be owned by the Reapers MC. Bolt was their vice president.</p><p>I&#x2019;d had the cleaning contract there for about six months now. They were becoming one of my most valuable accounts and had dropped hints about offering a second contract for The Line, their strip club. We&#x2019;d already come in a few times when they needed extra help, and I had high hopes it would grow into something bigger. I originally ran the Pawns crew myself, but two months ago I&#x2019;d turned it over to Jason, an older guy who&#x2019;d been with me for almost five years. He was reliable, worked hard, and did a great job managing the people under him.</p><p>The MC paid well, and they paid in cash, which was convenient. In return, we kept our mouths shut about anything we might see, which honestly wasn&#x2019;t as much as you&#x2019;d think. I thought there might be some prostitution happe...</p></p><h2>Beginning Reasoning and Reading</h2><p>This 140-page book is a compilation and complete revision of the four workbooks titled Beginning Word Meaning, Sentence Meaning, Paragraph Meaning, and Reasoning Skills.

The study of its social historyfamily life and street life, factory work and housekeeping, innocent pleasures and viceprovides an opportunity to examine questions of broad significance: trade union attitudes towards women, the issue of the family wage, the discrepancy between middle-class ideals and daily life in poor households. Stansell's perceptive analysis of these and other topics is skillfully worked into a rich and colorful portrait of working-class New York, with unforgettable sketches of its life. Without losing sight of the hardships of poverty she insists that working-class women possessed a degree of independence. Her study reveals a vigorous female culture that thrived in neighborhoods and in work groups. An important book that provides a fresh look at relations between sexes and classes. Mary Drake McFeely, Univ. of Georgia Lib., Athens<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.How women emerged as a distinctive class in the burgeoning society of New York City in the postCivil War era is explored from an original viewpoint in this interesting study. Female class relations, "ladies" and working women, were symbiotic. The laborers had their sexual and social demeanor regulated by their middle-class sisters, who had the leisure to act as "self-appointed exemplars of virtue." The women of the working class come to life in Stansell's identification of their lot. Adrift from family ties, they entered the labor force, many resorting to prostitution and crime, which provoked the philanthropy of genteel bourgeois women, social reformers and the rise of the settlement house movement. The neighborhoods of the poor, the tenements and bawdy houses of 19th century New York are portrayed as important elements in women's history. Stansell teaches at Princeton University. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Shadow Of What Was Lost</h2><p>Shadow of What Was Lost</p><p>James Islington was born and raised in southern Victoria, Australia.

For passion. For glory. The epic story of the knights templar.</p></blockquote><p>Born in 1150 to a noble family in the Kingdom of Western G�taland, young Arn Magnusson is marked early on by a miraculous and fateful event. When the boy inexplicably recovers after falling from the parapet of his ancestral home, his mother finds herself beholden to a promise made in a moment of prayer. Arn, second-born son of Magnus Folkesson, will live his life in the service of God&#x2014;sent from his family to do holy work and to prepare for a position in the priory.</p><p>At Varnhem monastery, Arn comes of age under the tutelage of Father Henri, a Cistercian monk devoted to his aristocratic pupil's education. However, grammar, math, and logic are not the only lessons: Brother Guilbert, the monastery blacksmith and former Knight Templar, finds Arn adept at training of a very different kind. Observing the boy's extraordinary talent with horse, sword, and bow, Father Henri, trusting in God's will, sends his charge into the world to fulfill a destiny that lies beyond the cloister walls.</p><p>Returning home, Arn finds his monastic habits at odds with his clan's old and tested ways. Yet his family soon discovers that Arn has learned more than poetry and farm work, and he proves himself useful at a time when he is needed most. The murder of a king has brought Western G�taland into a whirlwind of intrigue, and cunning lords from East and West are vying for power. And, when Arn meets the lovely Cecilia, he discovers this new and dangerous world holds other surprises too. Before he can claim her hand, however, the headstrong and na�ve noble makes a fateful mistake that will wrench him from his love and send him to a foreign war&#x2014;to the Holy Land to battle infidels for twenty years.</p><p>From the frozen landscapes of Northern Europe to the bloody battlefields of the Middle East, Arn will face brave knights, powerful queens, and treacherous kings.

From time to time Hege encourages her brother to find work to ease their financial burdens, but Mattis's attempts to work at the surrounding farms always end in failure and disgrace. Mattis is keenly aware of the distance between himself and the world around him, which often feels hostile; the villagers call him Simple Simon.&nbsp;<br>Profoundly sensitive to his surroundings, Mattis spends much of his time in the forest, reading its signs and symbols: A woodcock begins a daily flight over their house, a beautiful bird is waiting for him on the path one day when he returns from the store, and one afternoon lighting strikes one of the two withered aspen trees outside the house -- trees known in the village as "Mattis-and-Hege."<br><br>When Mattis decides to employ himself as a ferryman, the only passenger he manages to bring across the lake is a lumberjack, J�rgen. When J�rgen and Hege become lovers, Mattis finds he cannot adjust to this new situation. Wholly reliant on Hege and terrified of losing her, he clings to the familiar and does everything in his power to make J�rgen leave. Simultaneously, he struggles to find a place for himself in a world that does not seem to want him.<br><br>With spare simplicity, Vesaas's straightforward prose subtly reveals Mattis's perspective and readers will find themselves shifting irrevocably from observers of his experience to participants in it. Written by one of Norway's most celebrated and beloved authors, <i>The Birds</i> is a deeply nuanced examination of identity and responsibility, with abundant narrative suspense and hauntingly beautiful writing besides.</p><p>TARJEI VESAAS (1897-1970), author of twenty-five novels, and several volumes of poetry, short stories, and plays, is widely regarded as one of Norway's greatest writers of the twentieth century. His writing touches on a variety of difficult themes such as mortality, guilt, and angst, while often chronicling the deep intractable human emotions of his characters. Vesaas won a number of awards, including the the prestigious Nordic Council's Literature Prize in 1963 for his novel, <i>The Ice Palace</i>, and The Venice Prize in 1953 for <i>The Winds</i>.

Nuclear physicist and lecturer Stanton T. Friedman <br>has distilled more than 40 years of research on UFOs, and shares his work on a <br>wide variety of classified advanced nuclear and space systems. He answers a <br>number of physics questions in layman--s terms, and establishes that travel to <br>nearby stars is within reach without violating the laws of physics. <br>Photographs of little known, far-out advanced propulsion systems, on some of <br>which he worked, are included. Friedman also presents data demonstrating the <br>ability to withstand high accelerations with some surprising results. He clearly <br>shows that government policy on this subject has been to provide false, <br>misleading claims and disinformation, and establishes that the subject truly <br>represents a Cosmic Watergate.<br>Flying Saucers and Science presents intriguing data from a number of <br>large-scale scientific UFO studies that almost no one, especially the noisy <br>negativists, has discussed in detail. It deals with a host of "why" questions <br>such, as reasons for the cover-up, reasons for aliens to come to Earth, and <br>reasons for not landing on the White House lawn. Friedman unveils the SETI <br>program, and details the antipathy of science-fiction writers to UFOs and other <br>mysteries of the saucer conundrum.

But how do we achieve these goals, and how do we protect ourselves if we fail? The answer lies within the power of the mind.<br><br>Dr. Joseph Murphy, one of the world's best&#x2014;known authorities on the power of the subconscious mind, shows readers not only how to unleash this power, but how to harness it and effectively use it to change their lives.&nbsp;Fully updated to reflect the sensibilities of the 21st century, this revised edition of a self&#x2014;help classic is the key to overcoming the psychological barriers that stand in the way of greater material, spiritual, and emotional wealth.</p><p>A native of Ireland, Joseph Murphy (1898 &#x2014; 1981) was a prolific and widely admired New Thought minister and writer, best known for his motivational classic, <i>The Power of Your Subconscious Mind</i>, an international bestseller since it first blazed onto the self-help scene. His pamphlet <i>How to Attract Money</i> first appeared in 1955, and likewise entered many editions. Murphy wrote widely on the auto-suggestive and metaphysical faculties of the human mind and is considered one of the pioneering voices of affirmative-thinking philosophy.</p><h2>Centuries of Childhood: A Social History of Family Life</h2><p>The theme of this extraordinary book is the evolution of the modern conception of family life and the modern image; of the nature of children. Aries traces the evolution of the concept of childhood from the end of the Middle Ages, when the child was regarded as a small adult, to the present child-centered society, by means of diaries, paintings, games, and school curricula.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ironically, he finds that individualism, far from triumphing in our time, has been held in check by the family, and that the increasing power of the tightly-knit family circle has flourished at the expense of the rich-textured communal society of earlier times. Translated from the French by Robert Baldick.</p><p><b>Philippe Ari�s</b> was an important French medievalist and historian of the family and childhood.

It's also the story of how his service under Hitler was simplified and elevated to Western mythology during the Cold War.<br><br>Over 1,404 wartime missions, Hartmann claimed a staggering 352 airborne kills, and his career contains all the dramas you would expect. There were the frostbitten fighter sweeps over the Eastern Front, drunken forays to Hitler&#x2019;s Eagle&#x2019;s Nest, a decade of imprisonment in the wretched Soviet POW camps, and further military service during the Cold War that ended with conflict and angst.&nbsp;<br><br>Just when Hartmann&#x2019;s second career was faltering, he was adopted by a network of writers and commentators personally invested in his welfare and reputation. These men, mostly Americans, published elaborate, celebratory stories about Hartmann and his elite fraternity of <i>Luftwaffe</i> pilots. With each dogfight tale put into print, Hartmann&#x2019;s legacy became loftier and more secure, and his complicated service in support of Nazism faded away. A simplified, one-dimensional account of his life&#x2014;devoid of the harder questions about allegiance and service under Hitler&#x2014;has gone unchallenged for almost a generation.<br><br><i>Black Tulip</i>&nbsp;locates the ambiguous truth about Hartmann and so much of the German&nbsp;<i>Wehrmacht</i> in general: that many of these men were neither full-blown Nazis nor impeccable knights. They were complex, contradictory, and elusive. This book portrays a complex human rather than the heroic caricature we&#x2019;re used to, and it argues that the tidy, polished hero stories we&#x2019;ve inherited about men like Hartmann say as much about those who've crafted them as they do about the heroes themselves.<br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Introduction<br>Part 1: Inheritances<br>1. &#x2018;The force that is devoted to death&#x2019;<br>2.

Scottish samplers are unique with regard to the amount of information that can be gathered from them. They often include the initials of extended family members as well as details of buildings, places and events, leading to the identification of almost all of these young embroiderers. Leslie Durst, an American with a passion for Scotland, has a collection of over 500 samplers dating from the early 18th to the late 19th century; a small section of them will be exhibited at the National Museum of Scotland 26 October 2018 to 21 April 2019. This book showcases these and reveals the stories behind many of them - embroidered records of two centuries of Scottish social history.</p><p></p><h2>The Dragons of Winter (6) (Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica, The)</h2><p><b>The Archipelago of Dreams is no more...but the battle to save it has just begun in the penultimate book in the acclaimed Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica series.</b><br><br>The Caretakers are at war.

I never realized he&#x2019;d finished it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Finished it, and written a sequel,&#x201d; a familiar voice answered. The two men turned to see their friend Charles at the door, nodding enthusiastically as he strode into the room, arms outstretched. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s having a bit of trouble with the third one, though. Twain and I are helping him work through it.&#x201d;<br> <br>John&#x2019;s self-control was such that he managed to bite his tongue before blurting out what he wanted to say, but Jack was startled enough by Charles&#x2019;s appearance that he actually dropped the book he was holding.<br> <br>&#x201c;Charles!&#x201d; Jack sputtered. &#x201c;Your hair . . . it&#x2019;s&#x2014;it&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Purple,&#x201d; said John.<br> <br>&#x201c;Burgundy, actually,&#x201d; Charles said, preening slightly. &#x201c;Rose helped me color it. Isn&#x2019;t it striking?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s purple,&#x201d; Jack said, still staring openmouthed as he bent to pick up the book. &#x201c;Whatever possessed you, Charles? That&#x2019;s hardly a becoming color for an editor.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Possibly,&#x201d; said Charles, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s also the exact shade of burgundy as Queen Victoria&#x2019;s throne. I have it on good authority. And besides, I&#x2019;m not really just an editor anymore, am I? More of a soldier of fortune.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack and John traded disbelieving glances, and the latter asked, &#x201c;So, ah, who told you that was the color of Victoria&#x2019;s throne?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Geoffrey Chaucer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mmm,&#x201d; John hummed. &#x201c;I see.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was traditional, in the old-fraternal-order sort of way, for the Caretakers Emeriti to prank the newer members of their secret society. The problem was that every time John, Jack, and Charles had been present at Tamerlane House, it had been in a crisis situation, and there was no time or inclination for tomfoolery. But now that Charles was a full-time resident, John suspected that the Elder Caretakers&#x2014;specifically Chaucer&#x2014;were having a bit of fun.<br> <br>&#x201c;Rose helped me do it,&#x201d; Charles said again as he ran a hand through his full head of hair. &#x201c;She changes hers on a weekly basis.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d noticed,&#x201d; said John, &#x201c;but she&#x2019;s still a teenager, and you&#x2019;re . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dead,&#x201d; Charles said. &#x201c;But still optimistic about the future.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack laughed, and both he and John shook Charles&#x2019;s hands. &#x201c;Fair enough,&#x201d; John said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re always happy to see you, old fellow.&#x201d;<br> <br>The friends had gotten accustomed to having easy access to Tamerlane House through the use of Shakespeare&#x2019;s Bridge in the garden at the Kilns. Despite the pain they all still felt over the loss of the Archipelago, it was a comfort to be able to simply cross over and be in the company of the other Caretakers, and thus remind themselves of the value of the work they had done&#x2014;and the work they still had to do.<br> <br>Jack was busying himself with preparations for the eventual establishment of a reborn Imperial Cartological Society, including Apprentice and Associate Caretaker programs. It would have to remain an underground project until the Caretakers were truly ready to make it more public, but he and John had already begun actively recruiting the next generations of Caretakers, and were deliberately making it more of a global endeavor than it had been under Verne.<br> <br>&#x201c;I see you&#x2019;ve found Nathaniel&#x2019;s book,&#x201d; a voice whined from the doorway. It was Lord Byron, a disgraced Caretaker who was tolerated only reluctantly by the rest of them because of Poe&#x2019;s insistence that he be included. &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t as good as he thinks it is, you know. It was better when it was unfinished.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Say, George,&#x201d; Jack said, turning to address Byron, whose real name was George Gordon. &#x201c;I noticed that there&#x2019;s nothing new in your section of the library. Has inspiration finally failed you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hardly,&#x201d; Byron sniffed. &#x201c;I have more inspiration in my little toe than you have in your whole body. I don&#x2019;t need to write to demonstrate that&#x2014;my life is my art.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re dead, you idiot,&#x201d; said Sir James Barrie as he entered the room, accompanied by Charles&#x2019;s apprentice Caretaker, the badger Fred.<br> <br>&#x201c;Death is but a new adventure . . . ,&#x201d; Byron began before the others&#x2019; laughter cut him off. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; he said, a blush rising in his cheeks. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s funny about that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, George,&#x201d; Jack said, giving the poet&#x2019;s shoulder an appreciative squeeze. &#x201c;All I meant was that I&#x2019;ve often wondered why someone of your talent never applied it to some grand epic, or an ongoing work of proportions worthy of your ability. That&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; said Byron, who wasn&#x2019;t certain whether that was actually an apology. &#x201c;I simply never found the right tale for that kind of treatment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought Bert might be with you,&#x201d; John said, shaking Barrie&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Does he know we&#x2019;re here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t say,&#x201d; Barrie answered. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been keeping to himself lately, but I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;ll be along shortly. The war council was his idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>As the Caretakers talked, Fred maintained a respectful distance and kept his opinions to himself. Technically speaking, an apprentice Caretaker had all the standing of a full Caretaker, especially among those at Tamerlane House. But Fred was still a little uncertain about his own position, considering his predecessor was technically deceased. Charles was himself still considered a Caretaker, but a Caretaker Emeritus. He was, like Verne and Kipling, a <i>tulpa</i>&#x2014;a near-immortal, youthful, new body housing an old soul. And unlike the majority of the other Caretakers, who were portraits in Tamerlane, and who could leave the frames for only one week, he could go almost anywhere&#x2014;as long as it wasn&#x2019;t somewhere he&#x2019;d been known when he was alive.<br> <br>To the animals, dead was dead, and while they tolerated the portraits, none of them&#x2014;especially the badgers&#x2014;could quite accept the tulpas. It was something about their smell, Fred once said to Jack&#x2014;there was none. Tulpas gave off no odor at all. And to an animal, who determines friend or enemy, truth or lies, based on smell&#x2014;that made the whole idea completely suspect.<br> <br>Still, he was sworn to serve the Caretakers, as were his father and grandfather before him, and of them all, Charles had the strongest bond to the badgers. So Fred was cheerfully stoic. Mostly.<br> <br>&#x201c;You could do as John is doing,&#x201d; Jack continued, &#x201c;and base a great work on stories of the Archipelago.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I learned my lesson about that ages ago,&#x201d; Byron grumbled. &#x201c;They set fire to me, remember? And that was just on general principles. I&#x2019;d hate to see what the others would do to me if I broke one of the cardinal rules of the Archipelago.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Others have done it before me,&#x201d; said John. &#x201c;Most of them, actually. And as long as the stories or characters are disguised or altered, and no secrets of the Archipelago are revealed, it isn&#x2019;t really a problem.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Technically speaking,&#x201d; said Charles, &#x201c;you aren&#x2019;t revealing any secrets about the Archipelago, because there&#x2019;s nothing left to keep any secrets about.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Believing is seeing,&#x201d; Fred murmured in a low voice. &#x201c;Believing is seeing, Scowler . . . Charles.&#x201d; He twitched his whiskers as if he were about to say something more, then turned abruptly and scurried out of the room, closing the door behind him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, me,&#x201d; Charles said, sighing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve put my foot in it again, haven&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No argument there,&#x201d; said Jack.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d think finding his father was really alive, and not lost with the rest of the Archipelago, would have cheered him somewhat,&#x201d; said Barrie, &#x201c;but he can&#x2019;t push past the loss of everything else, I fear.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was his world,&#x201d; said John. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s gone. You can&#x2019;t fault the little fellow for feeling as he does.&#x201d;<br> <br>Charles sighed heavily. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;No, we can&#x2019;t. But I wish it were at least easier for him to accept that I&#x2019;m, well, me. Myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Remember, Charles,&#x201d; said Barrie. &#x201c;All good things happen . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;. . . in time.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a knock at the door. Percy Shelley opened it and stepped into the room. He scowled at Byron, then regained his composure and faced the other Caretakers. &#x201c;Gentlemen,&#x201d; he said, gesturing back down the hall. &#x201c;Summon the others to the meeting room, if you please. The war council will begin within the hour.&#x201d;<br><br>Charles led his companions to the inner courtyard of the house, where Sir Richard Burton and the Valkyrie called Laura Glue were instructing Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, and Rose Dyson in the ancient art of the samurai sword.<br> <br>Each held a <i>katana</i> about three feet long and was in a stance of readiness. The girls faced each other, while Burton faced both of the other men. He barked a command, and all of them erupted in a flurry of shouts and clashing metal.<br> <br>&#x201c;I never caught the knack of it,&#x201d; Charles said over the din. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d land a good blow with one of the wooden practice swords, then pause to apologize to my opponent and allow him to regain his footing. It&#x2019;s an honorable discipline, but it really doesn&#x2019;t mesh well with gentlemanly chivalry.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girls were evenly matched, and fought to a draw&#x2014;but after handily disarming Hawthorne, Burton found himself driven to his knees by Twain, who finally relented when he realized they had an audience.<br> <br>The combatants turned to face their visitors, and John was struck by how Rose seemed to have changed since his last visit. There, in battle gear, with newly colored blue hair and holding a sword, she seemed to have grown older overnight, and for a moment he felt a wistfulness for the child she had been when they first met. But then again, he reminded himself, she had never truly been a child&#x2014;something for which he felt honest regret.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uncle John! Uncle Jack! Uncle Charles!&#x201d; Rose exclaimed as she tossed away her sword and jumped across the lawn to hug and kiss the three companions. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know you were here!&#x201d;<br> <br>Laura Glue also went to greet the Caretakers, but only after retrieving Rose&#x2019;s sword. &#x201c;I told you,&#x201d; she said, glaring at the other girl as she hugged Jack, &#x201c;never drop your sword. It must be a part of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Something Samuel here has learned too well,&#x201d; Burton said as he dusted off his trousers and rose to his feet. He glowered at Twain as they greeted the others.<br> <br>&#x201c;He may look older than the rest of you,&#x201d; Burton said to John, &#x201c;but he&#x2019;s really full of&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Spirit,&#x201d; Twain said, winking at John. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m full of so much spirit it just spills out of me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Percy asked us to fetch you,&#x201d; said Charles. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost time for the council.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Burton said, handing his <i>katana</i> to Hawthorne. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll just pick up the lesson another time. Maybe next time you can fight Laura Glue, Caretaker.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, no,&#x201d; said Hawthorne. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s better than <i>you</i> are.&#x201d;<br> <br> John pulled Twain aside as the others gathered their weapons together. &#x201c;Where is Bert?&#x201d; he asked, concerned. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s usually first to greet us, and we were expecting to have seen him well before now.&#x201d;<br> <br>A look of concern mixed with worry crossed the older Caretaker&#x2019;s features as he gestured at the three of them. &#x201c;Come with me,&#x201d; he said, turning down one of the corridors. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something you need to see.&#x201d;<br><br>As the others went to the room where the war council was to be held, Twain led John, Jack, Charles, and Rose to a large screening room. It was darkened, save for the light coming from the projector in the center of the room.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that . . . ?&#x201d; John asked, staring at the projection in astonishment.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Twain answered. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the film you brought back from the Archipelago.&#x201d;<br> <br>The reel had been created by Bert&#x2019;s daughter, Aven, and left in the ruined palace on Paralon for the Caretakers to find&#x2014;but neither they nor she had expected it would be two thousand years of Archipelago time before that would happen. Two millennia, during which Aven had lain in a deathless sleep. Most of those centuries were spent in a rarely interrupted hibernation inside a bed of crystal; but before that, she had ensured that there would be a way for her friends to find out what had happened, as well as a means to try to make things right, via the film Bert was now watching.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d been able to speak to the projected image when they found it, but now it was simply a recorded memory of the friend who never lost hope that they would come&#x2014;and who paid the ultimate price to do so.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a rare day that goes by,&#x201d; Twain said, his voice low, &#x201c;that he hasn&#x2019;t watched it through at least once. More commonly, he watches it several times at a sitting. Then he goes back to his work as if he hadn&#x2019;t a trouble in the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bert&#x2019;s daughter had been a reluctant queen of the Silver Throne of Paralon. She much preferred her life as a dashing buccaneer and captain of the <i>Indigo Dragon</i>, and after her marriage to King Artus, did her level best to maintain that life, even as she kept an eye to her responsibilities on Paralon. But then Artus was killed in the conflict with the Shadow King, and suddenly the entire Archipelago was looking toward Aven to lead. And lead she did, right up to the moment the Keep of Time fell&#x2014;and then for two thousand years after.<br> <br>The companions were at a loss as to what they could say to console the old Caretaker. Of all that they had lost in their many conflicts, John thought, it was their mentor who had paid the dearest price. And it was a loss that could not be mended.<br> <br>Bert finally noticed the group at the door and quickly reached out to shut off the projector. The image of Aven vanished abruptly from the screen, and the room darkened to twilight. &#x201c;Ah, I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he said, wiping at the tears on his face. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t realize you were there. Just, ah . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We know,&#x201d; John said gently. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, Bert.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How far can I go?&#x201d; Rose asked abruptly. She was looking at Bert as she spoke. &#x201c;With Edmund&#x2019;s help, how far in time can I travel?&#x201d;<br> <br>The others looked confused, but Twain realized what she was asking, if not entirely why.<br> <br>&#x201c;It would be my wager,&#x201d; Twain said, puffing on his cigar, &#x201c;that young Rose here, with assistance from our new Cartographer, could go anywhere&#x2014;anywhen&#x2014;she chose. Isn&#x2019;t that correct, Bert?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Bert replied, looking back at Rose. &#x201c;At least, that is our hope. That&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ve been working toward, after all,&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;finding a way to go far enough back to rebuild the Keep of Time. That will be your mission, and the reason I&#x2019;ve called the war council. It&#x2019;s time. And you&#x2019;re ready, I think.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That may be the primary mission, but it doesn&#x2019;t have to be the only one,&#x201d; Rose said. &#x201c;Before we can attempt to go back into Deep Time, we&#x2019;ll have to go forward into the future anyway, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Farther than <i>almost</i> anyone has ever been,&#x201d; Twain agreed, nodding as he ushered the others out of the room, &#x201c;to one of the only zero points we have recorded that distantly in the future. About eight thousand centuries, wasn&#x2019;t it, Bert?&#x201d;<br> <br>The old man didn&#x2019;t answer, but his bottom lip quivered, and his eyes started to well with tears. &#x201c;Rose,&#x201d; he began, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never asked you to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>She stepped closer to him, taking his hands in hers, and shook her head. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to ask,&#x201d; she said, smiling. &#x201c;Of course we&#x2019;re going to try&#x2014;as I said, we have to go there anyway.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve lost me,&#x201d; said Charles, scratching his head. &#x201c;W...</p><h2>The Weather of the Pacific Northwest</h2><p>The Pacific Northwest experiences the most varied and fascinating weather in the United States, including world-record winter snows, the strongest non-tropical storms in the nation, and shifts from desert to rain forest in a matter of miles. Local weather features dominate the meteorological landscape, from the Puget Sound convergence zone and wind surges along the Washington Coast, to gap winds through the Columbia Gorge and the &#x201c;Banana Belt&#x201d; of southern Oregon. This book is the first comprehensive and authoritative guide to Northwest weather that is directed to the general reader; helpful to boaters, hikers, and skiers; and valuable to expert meteorologists.<br><br>In <i>The Weather of the Pacific Northwest</i>, University of Washington atmospheric scientist and popular radio commentator Cliff Mass unravels the intricacies of Northwest weather, from the mundane to the mystifying. By examining our legendary floods, snowstorms, and windstorms, and a wide variety of local weather features, Mass answers such interesting questions as:<br><br>o Why does the Northwest have localized rain shadows?<br><br>o What is the origin of the hurricane force winds that often buffet the region?<br><br>o Why does the Northwest have so few thunderstorms?<br><br>o What is the origin of the Pineapple Express?<br><br>o Why do ferryboats sometimes seem to float above the water's surface?<br><br>o Why is it so hard to predict Northwest weather?<br><br>Mass brings together eyewitness accounts, historical records, and meteorological science to explain Pacific Northwest weather. He also considers possible local effects of global warming. The final chapters guide readers in interpreting the Northwest sky and in securing weather information on their own.</p><p>"Cliff Mass has written an excellent, clear and comprehensive survey of weather in this region covering the origin and incidence of all major weather phenomena in the Northwest from rain to wind to snow to drought to optical illusions. Weather, as Cliff makes abundantly clear, is not just a source of griping or amusement or awe in this region, but often a life and death matter." - David Laskin, author of <i>Rains All the Time</i> and <i>The Children's Blizzard</i> <p> "The book uniquely includes solid scientific rigor in explanations that help to unravel the many mysteries and curiosities of the weather in the Pacific Northwest. It provides an unsurpassed opportunity to interested laypersons and weather enthusiasts to learn not only about the many weather events that occur in the Northwest but also to understand the meteorological principles that are at the root of their existence." - Brad Colman, NOAA/National Weather Service</p><b>Cliff Mass </b>, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington and weekly guest on KUOW radio, is the preeminent authority on Northwest weather.

This is the location of the Sea Ranch, an area covering several thousand acres of large, open meadows and forested natural settings and interspersed with award-winning architecture. The ecologically inspired plan drawn up for the Sea Ranch in the mid-1960s caused a quiet revolution in architecture. Renowned landscape designer Lawrence Halprin&#39;s master plan incorporated a set of building guidelines that structured the visual, as well as physical, impact upon the landscape. Subsequent buildings by architects such as Joseph Esherick, Charles Willard Moore, Donlyn Lyndon, and William Turnbull have been recognized worldwide for their remarkable environmental sensitivity. This revised and updated edition of the now-classic monograph, the only one on the Sea Ranch, contains eleven additional projects and an updated account of the ongoing development process and land-management issues.</p><p>Donlyn Lyndon was one of the founding partners of the renowned architecture firm Moore, Lyndon, Turnbull, Whitaker (MLTW).<br><br>Jim Alinder is an internationally recognized fine-art photographer."The publication of this comprehensive, beautifully designed and photographed record could hardly be more timely." -- <i>Architects Journal, April 29, 2004</i><br><br>"This book is a handsome, thoughtful celebration of the best of what survives from the original vision." -- <i>LA Architect, July 2004</i><br><br>...one of the most influential developments of the 1960's...it's genesis, history and present state are thoughtfully chronicled... -- <i>The Architectural Review</i><br><br>THE SEA RANCH provides substantial variation on a few architectural themes and is worth studying for its details. -- <i>Architectural Record, April 2005</i><br><br>The first photos...bring you right back if you've been lucky enough to experience this special speck of the planet. -- <i>Society of Architectural Historians - Southern California Chapter</i></p><h2>Historical Linguistics: An Introduction (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>The new edition of a comprehensive, accessible, and hands-on text in historical linguistics, revised and expanded to reflect recent developments in the field.</b></p><p>This accessible, hands-on textbook not only introduces students to the important topics in historical linguistics but also shows them how to apply the methods described and how to think about the issues. Abundant examples and exercises allow students to focus on how to do historical linguistics. The book is distinctive for its integration of the standard topics with others now considered important to the field, including syntactic change, grammaticalization, sociolinguistic contributions to linguistic change, distant genetic relationships, areal linguistics, and linguistic prehistory. It also offers a defense of the family tree model, a response to recent claims on lexical diffusion/frequency, and a section on why languages diversify and spread. Examples are taken from a broad range of languages; those from the more familiar English, French, German, and Spanish make the topics more accessible, while those from non-Indo-European languages show the depth and range of the concepts they illustrate.</p><p>This third edition includes new material based on the latest developments in the field, increased coverage of computational approaches, and additional exercises.

Karl Schwenke's clear-eyed approach to the best farming methods covers a wide range of proven techniques and practical advice, including: </p><p> * How to improve, conserve, and enrich your soil organically, to ensure the highest (and healthiest) yields.</p><p> * What machinery you'll need and how to use it.</p><p> * The best "cash crops" and specialty crops to grow for profit and how to raise them.</p><p> * How to use innovative strategies to find or create a market "niche" for your farm's crops or services.</p><p> * A concise overview of essential farmstead skills, such as haying, fencing, and managing a woodlot.</p><p> * Numerous charts and tables that put useful calculations at your fingertips.</p><p> With today's increased concern for the quality of the food we eat and the health of our environment, Successful Small-Scale Farming offers a unique and invaluable perspective on the future of agriculture. Karl Schwenke's message -- that small-scale farms can be cleaner, smarter, and more efficient than corporate agribusiness -- has never been so relevant as it is today.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Karl Schwenke is a professional writer who lives with wife Sue on a farm in Newbury, Vermont, where they have raised strawberries, pigs and hay among other crops. Together, this couple has written the book Build Your Own Stone House, and Karl wrote the Storey title Successful Small-Scale Farming. His other work includes Sierra North and Sierra South from Wilderness Press, an organization in Berkeley, California, that he co-founded after graduating from college. Karl has also written In a Pig&#39;s Eye (Chelsea Green Publishing).</p><h2>The Pale King</h2><p>The agents at the IRS Regional Examination Center in Peoria, Illinois, appear ordinary enough to newly arrived trainee David Foster Wallace. But as he immerses himself in a routine so tedious and repetitive that new employees receive boredom-survival training, he learns of the extraordinary variety of personalities drawn to this strange calling. And he has arrived at a moment when forces within the IRS are plotting to eliminate even what little humanity and dignity the work still has.<br><br><i>The Pale King</i> remained unfinished at the time of David Foster Wallace's death, but it is a deeply compelling and satisfying novel, hilarious and fearless and as original as anything Wallace ever undertook. It grapples directly with ultimate questions--questions of life's meaning and of the value of work and society--through characters imagined with the interior force and generosity that were Wallace's unique gifts. Along the way it suggests a new idea of heroism and commands infinite respect for one of the most daring writers of our time.</p><p>David Foster Wallace was born in Ithaca, New York, in 1962 and raised in Illinois, where he was a regionally ranked junior tennis player. He received bachelor of arts degrees in philosophy and English from Amherst College and wrote what would become his first novel, <em>The Broom of the System</em>, as his senior English thesis. He received a masters of fine arts from University of Arizona in 1987 and briefly pursued graduate work in philosophy at Harvard University. His second novel,<em> Infinite Jest</em>, was published in 1996. Wallace taught creative writing at Emerson College, Illinois State University, and Pomona College, and published the story collections <em>Girl with Curious Hair</em>, <em>Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</em>, <em>Oblivion, </em>the essay collections <em>A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again,</em> and <em>Consider the Lobster</em>. He was awarded the MacArthur Fellowship, a Lannan Literary Award, and a Whiting Writers' Award, and was appointed to the Usage Panel for The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. He died in 2008. His last novel, <em>The Pale King</em>, was published in 2011."Wallace's finest work as a novelist...when Wallace steers the tanker back to its theme--the struggle to extract meaning from each second that passes, no matter how empty or lonely or indistinguishable from the second that came before it<strong>--</strong><i>The Pale King</i> achieves power levels that Wallace never reached in his first two novels....His ability to render the fine finials and fractals and flourishes of a mind acting upon itself, from moment to moment, using only the blunt, numb instruments of language, has few if any equals in American literature."&#x2015;<b><i>Lev Grossman, <em>TIME</em></i></b><br><br>"Deeply sad, deeply philosophical...By turns breathtakingly brilliant and stupefying dull--funny, maddening and elegiac...in almost everything Wallace wrote, including THE PALE KING, he aimed to use words to lasso and somehow subdue the staggering, multifarious, cacophonous predicament that is modern American life."&#x2015;<b><i>Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times</i></i></b><br><br>"Feverishly encompassing, sharply comedic, and haunting...this is not a novel of defeat but, rather, of oddly heroic persistence....electrifying in its portrayal of individuals seeking unlikely refuge in a vast, absurd bureaucracy. In the spirit of Borges, Gaddis, and Terry Gilliam's <em>Brazil</em>, Wallace conducts a commanding and ingenious inquiry into monumental boredom, sorrow, the deception of appearances, and the redeeming if elusive truth that any endeavor, however tedious, however impossible, can become a conduit to enlightenment.'"&#x2015;<b><i>Donna Seaman, <i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</i></b><br><br>"Nothing short of sublime--the first two chapters are a real put-the-reader-on-notice charging bull blitz, and the David Foster Wallace sections...are tiny masterpieces....achingly funny...pants-pissingly hilarious."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Publishers Weekly</em></i></b><br><br>"One of the saddest and most lovely books I've ever read...Let's state this clearly: You should read THE PALE KING....You'll be [kept up at night] because D.F.W. writes sentences and sometimes whole pages that make you feel like you can't breathe."&#x2015;<b><i>Benjamin Alsup, <i>Esquire</i></i></b></p><h2>Fundamentals of Instrumentation</h2><p>Using a distinctive blend of theory-based explanations and real-world applications, Fundamentals of Instrumentation, 2E will guide users through the basics of instrumentation - from installation to wiring, process connections, and calibration.

Linnaeus and his world--18th-century Sweden--may seem far removed from most middle-graders' experiences, but Anderson creates a dramatic narrative fully capable of keeping readers enthralled. The elements of Linnaeus's life are used to maximum effect: At nine he was told that he was a hopeless student; as a young man, he perfected his own system of binomial nomenclature used to classify plant life. Throughout the story, Anderson shows how the personal side of Linnaeus's life affected his profession: Although he was beset by financial problems for years, he succeeded as an explorer and scientist, eventually achieving fame and wealth as a college professor with a family of his own. The portrait is accurately rendered, and although Linnaeus is imperfect by 20th-century standards--refusing to educate his daughters and remaining distant from his wife--Anderson finds in his life an upbeat story of a man achieving his dreams.

Well organized and clearly written, although at times stilted, this biography of the developer of binomial nomenclature for classifying plants and animals has easy-to-read, open pages with large print and wide margins. Black-and-white illustrations include portraits of the Linnaeus family and photographs of their homes and the universities in which this Swedish scientist taught and did his research. The narrative includes many anecdotes about his family and experiences with people who influenced his life and work. Much of the book is devoted to his many scientific expeditions collecting and studying plant and animal life and to his teaching career. Simple plant experiments and some examples of Linnaeus's classification system are included. This sound chronological study provides useful report material in a rather bland package.?Cynthia M.

The approach, informed by twenty-five years of classroom teaching, emphasizes reading Greek for comprehension as opposed to merely translating it. The workbook is integrated into the textbook, with exercises appearing within each chapter rather than pushed to the end or located in a separate book. This enables students to practice concepts as they encounter them in the chapter--ideal for distance learning or studying beyond the traditional classroom. The book covers not only New Testament Greek but also the wider range of Bible-related Greek (LXX and other Koine texts). It introduces students to reference tools for biblical Greek, includes tips on learning, and is supplemented by robust web-based resources through Baker Academic&#39;s Textbook eSources. Resources for students include flash cards and audio files. Resources for professors include a test bank and an instructor&#39;s manual.</p><p>"<i>Reading Koine Greek</i> is readable and user friendly, yet remarkably sophisticated linguistically. Students learn not just forms and paradigms but, far more important, how language works and how the text as a whole functions as a communicative event. Students will also benefit from the hands-on workbook approach, which teaches by using Greek examples from the New Testament, the Septuagint, and other Koine texts. This is a pedagogically effective, accurate, and comprehensive text."<br>--<b>Mark L. Strauss</b>, Bethel Seminary San Diego<br><br>"A wonderful Koine Greek grammar for the twenty-first century.

Campbell</b>, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>"<i>Reading Koine Greek</i> reflects the most recent discussion of the Greek language, presented in a clear and practical way.

Ciampa</b>, Nida Institute for Biblical Scholarship and Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary<br><br>"It is a joy to see a new textbook in Biblical Greek in keeping with the best of traditional pedagogy that is also attuned to more recent insights into how students learn and how the language works.

"Not at all," says Charles Swindoll.</p><p>In this groundbreaking book, Swindoll invites us to join him on a spiritual quest. "I believe God's will for us in this life is not some black-and-white objective designed to take us to an appointed destination here on earth as much as it is about the journey itself . . . and what matters to Him in our lives."</p><p><i>The Mystery of God's Will</i> overflows with practical insights, humor, and unforgettable stories that will de-mystify, clarify, and put your mind at ease.</p></p><p>Charles R.

Thorough, thought-provoking and richly illustrated, CAPTURING LIGHT IN OILS will help artists create paintings that truly reflect their vision.</p><p>Paul Strisik painted light and color in all its manifestations. He went beyond mere description to explore the reasons why things look the way they do. There is luminosity in Strisik&#39;s skies that glimmers off the earth, glosses the surface of the water and reveals his excitement and emotional involvement in the subject. Paul Strisik was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. In 1955 he moved to Rockport, Ma. where he maintained his studio and gallery until his death in 1998. He traveled extensively in North America and abroad to enjoy the challenge of new subjects. He was a dedicated plein air painter, finding even the briefest outdoor studies carried him back to the subject more true to the feeling, the light and the mood of the place than photographs. His photographs were used for intricate details. An occasional interior or still life offered him a change of pace from his outdoor activities. He worked in both oil and watercolor. Strisik was particularly fond of painting the Southwest where he had a second home in Santa Fe for a number of years. Paul studied at the Art Students League in New York with Frank Vincent Dumond. It was from Dumond that he learned about cause and effect, to learn what causes appearances in order to paint the effect with understanding. He exhibited in numerous national exhibitions including The National Academy of Design, N.Y., American Watercolor Society, N.Y., The Royal Watercolor Society, London, England, 1992, Catto Gallery, London, 1992, Artists of American Show, Cowboy Hall of Fame, Oklahoma City, Ok.

His last book, &#34;Capturing Light in Oils&#34;, a Northlight Publication was released in 1995.

Many parents live in fear of the day their child asks this question?which inevitably happens, often as early as the preschool years. Here is a picture book designed especially for young children who are becoming aware of their bodies, but aren?t ready to learn about sexual intercourse. Written with warmth and honesty, <i>Amazing You! </i>presents clear and age-appropriate information about reproduction, birth, and the difference between girls? and boys? bodies. Lynne Cravath?s lighthearted illustrations enliven the text, making this a book that parents will gladly share with their young ones.</p><p>Dr. Gail Saltz lives in New York City. Lynne Cravath lives in Phoenix, Arizona.PreSchool-Grade 1&#x2013;This title tackles basic body awareness and sex education. The text speaks directly to young children, differentiating between body parts that are visible most of the time and those that are kept hidden, showing the differences between girls and boys and offering a simple explanation of how babies are made without explicit reference to sex. Cravath's sunny cartoons show the various parts in a straightforward manner, though preschoolers may be confused about where the internal ones are. The text also uses terms such as "vagina" and "urinate" without actually explaining what they mean, and, curiously, the text does not discuss breasts at all, though there are side-by-side illustrations of a boy and girl in the baby, preschool, and adult stages. An author's note advises parents on the finer points of discussing these delicate issues. Though Laurie Krasny Brown's <i>What's the Big Secret?: Talking about Sex with Girls and Boys</i> (Little, Brown, 1997) remains the gold standard for sex ed for young children, this book is a friendly supplement or a nice starter for parents who aren't quite ready to go into the detail provided in Brown's book.&#x2013;<i>Kathleen Kelly MacMillan, Maryland School for the Deaf, Columbia</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

H. Munro&#x2014;better known as Saki&#x2014;skewer the banality and hypocrisy of polite English society between the end of the Victorian era and the beginning of World War I. Saki&#x2019;s heroes are enfants terribles who marshal their considerable wit and imagination against the cruelty and fatuousness of a decorous and doomed world.<br><br>Here, Saki&#x2019;s brilliantly polished dark gems are paired with illustrations by the peerless Edward Gorey, available for the first time in an English-language edition. The fragile elegance and creeping menace of Gorey&#x2019;s pen-and-ink drawings perfectly complements Saki&#x2019;s population of delicate ladies, mischief-making charges, spectral guests, sardonic house pets, flustered authority figures, and delightfully preposterous imposters.</p><p><b>SAKI</b> (Hector Hugh Munro; 1870&#x2013;1916) was born to a military police officer father in British-controlled Burma. After the death of his mother in 1872, Munro and his two older siblings were sent to live in Devon, England, with their paternal grandmother and aunts. Munro was considered sickly and received casual tutoring at home until the age of ten, though he was later sent to boarding school. In 1887 his father retired to England and began several years of travel on the Continent with his children. In 1893 Munro joined the Indian Imperial police in Burma (where he reportedly kept a tiger cub as a pet) but contracted malaria after a year and returned to Devon. By 1894 he had resolved to become a writer and, subsidized by his father, moved to London, where he would receive public recognition for a series of political satires based on <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. From 1902 to 1909 he worked as a foreign correspondent in the Balkans, Russia, and Paris while publishing short stories and sketches in newspapers; these pieces were gathered in the collections <i>Reginald</i> (1904), <i>Reginald in Russia</i> (1910), <i>The Chronicles of Clovis</i> (1911), <i>Beasts and Super-Beasts</i> (1914), and the posthumous <i>The Toys of Peace</i> (1923). In addition to short stories, Munro also wrote a full-length play, <i>The Watched Pot</i>, in collaboration with Charles Maude; two one-act plays; a historical study, <i>The Rise of the Russian Empire</i>; a short novel, <i>The Unbearable Bassington</i>; and a fantasy about England under German occupation, <i>When William Came</i>. Having enlisted for service in World War I despite being officially over-age, Munro was killed in action near Beaumont-Hamel, France.<br><br><b>Edward Gorey</b> (1925&#x2013;2000) was born in Chicago. He studied briefly at the Art Institute of Chicago, spent three years in the army testing poison gas, and attended Harvard College, where he majored in French literature and roomed with the poet Frank O&#x2019;Hara. In 1953 Gorey published <i>The Unstrung Harp</i>, the first of his many extraordinary books, which include <i>The Curious Sofa</i>, <i>The Haunted Tea-Cosy</i>, and <i>The Epiplectic Bicycle</i>. <br><br>In addition to illustrating his own books, Edward Gorey provided drawings to countless books for both children and adults. Of these, New York Review Books has published <i>The Haunted Looking Glass</i>, a collection of Gothic tales that he selected and illustrated; <i>The War of the Worlds</i> by H. G. Wells; <i>Men and Gods</i>, a retelling of ancient Greek myths by Rex Warner; in collaboration with Rhoda Levine, <i>Three Ladies Beside the Sea</i> and <i>He Was There from the Day We Moved In</i>; and <i>The Unrest-Cure and Other Stories</i>, a collection of tales by Saki.&#x201c;Like Wilde and Wodehouse, Saki knew his way round the clubs and country houses of the upper classes, whose absurdities and hypocrisies he exposed with razor-sharp wit. . . . One is delighted to discover a writer with a vision of humanity shot through with a pessimism as bleak as that of Swift, C�line, Bernhard, Kingsley Amis.&#x201d; &#x2014;Patrick McGrath<br><br>&#x201c;A strange exotic creature, this Saki. For we were so domestic, he so terrifyingly cosmopolitan. While we were being funny, as planned, with collar-studs and hot-water bottles, he was being much funnier with werewolves and tigers.&#x201d; &#x2014;A. A. Milne<br><br>&#x201c;The epigrams, the absurdities fly unremittingly back and forth, they dazzle and delight. . . . Saki, like a chivalrous highwayman, only robs the rich: behind all these stories is an exacting sense of justice.&#x201d; &#x2014;Graham Greene<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Start a Saki story and you will finish it. Finish one and you will start another, and having finished them all you will never forget them. They remain an addiction because they are so much more than funny.&#x201d; &#x2014;Tom Sharpe<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Saki was incapable of writing a dull sentence, but the final lines of his short stories are works of art in themselves...[He] has been called 'the most malicious writer of them all,' and while it's true that an air of cruelty runs through much of his work, the recipients of Saki's malice always deserve their fates&#x2014;be they overbearing, child-hating aunts, self-important politicos or tedious club-land bores.... In an age when many artists have forgotten the wise adage that more is less, it is timely to remember a writer who often said more in the 2,000 or so words of a short story than many others have in a lifetime.&#x201d; &#x2014;Neil Clark, <i>The Telegraph</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It is for the terse brilliance of his short stories that he is remembered 92 years after his death...weird, but in a good way.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Guardian</i></p><h2>Labyrinths : Selected Stories and Other Writings</h2><p>Jorge Luis Borges was a literary spellbinder whose tales of magic, mystery and murder are shot through with deep philosophical paradoxes. This collection brings together many of his stories, including the celebrated &#34;Library of Babel&#34;.</p><p>If Jorge Luis Borges had been a computer scientist, he probably would have invented hypertext and the World Wide Web. <p> Instead, being a librarian and one of the world's most widely read people, he became the leading practitioner of a densely layered imaginistic writing style that has been imitated throughout this century, but has no peer (although Umberto Eco sometimes comes close, especially in <i>Name of the Rose</i>). </p><p> Borges's stories are redolent with an intelligence, wealth of invention, and a tight, almost mathematically formal style that challenge with mysteries and paradoxes revealed only slowly after several readings. Highly recommended to anyone who wants their imagination and intellect to be aswarm with philosophical plots, compelling conundrums, and a wealth of real and imagined literary references derived from an infinitely imaginary library.</p>Borges was born in Buenos Aires in 1899. A poet, critic and short story writer, he received numerous awards for his work including the 1961 International Publisher&#39;s Prize (shared with Samuel Beckett). He died in 1986. He has a reasonable claim, with Kafka and Joyce, to be the most influential writer of the 20th Century.</p><h2>Focus on Personal Finance</h2><p><p><em>Focus on Personal Finance</em> is a brief, 14-chapter book, covering the critical topics in Personal Finance courses.

As Ken Pomeranz shows, as recently as 1750, parallels between these two parts of the world were very high in life expectancy, consumption, product and factor markets, and the strategies of households. Perhaps most surprisingly, Pomeranz demonstrates that the Chinese and Japanese cores were no worse off ecologically than Western Europe. Core areas throughout the eighteenth-century Old World faced comparable local shortages of land-intensive products, shortages that were only partly resolved by trade.</p><br><p> Pomeranz argues that Europe's nineteenth-century divergence from the Old World owes much to the fortunate location of coal, which substituted for timber. This made Europe's failure to use its land intensively much less of a problem, while allowing growth in energy-intensive industries. Another crucial difference that he notes has to do with trade. Fortuitous global conjunctures made the Americas a greater source of needed primary products for Europe than any Asian periphery. This allowed Northwest Europe to grow dramatically in population, specialize further in manufactures, and remove labor from the land, using increased imports rather than maximizing yields. Together, coal and the New World allowed Europe to grow along resource-intensive, labor-saving paths.</p><br><p> Meanwhile, Asia hit a cul-de-sac. Although the East Asian hinterlands boomed after 1750, both in population and in manufacturing, this growth prevented these peripheral regions from exporting vital resources to the cloth-producing Yangzi Delta. As a result, growth in the core of East Asia's economy essentially stopped, and what growth did exist was forced along labor-intensive, resource-saving paths--paths Europe could have been forced down, too, had it not been for favorable resource stocks from underground and overseas.</p></p><p><p>"Pomeranz uses that European invention--economics--to overturn Eurocentrism, establishing beyond cavil a New Fact in our world. Never again will Europeans imagine they stood alone in the doorway of economic growth. Pomeranz and his colleagues in the new sinology have reintroduced the Central Kingdom and its stunning historical sources, and Pomeranz has written the one essential book."--<b>Deirdre McClosky, University of Iowa</b></p> <p>"Pomeranz uses a mixture of institutional forces and technological/geological luck to explain how an economic and ecological 'tie game' suddenly became a victory for western Europe over China. He combines global imagination with the scientific detail needed to make his points hold firm. <i>The Great Divergence</i> should command widespread respect."--<b>Peter H. Lindert, University of California, Davis</b></p> <p>"A truly magisterial effort based on an immense knowledge of the field, a vast amount of reading, and on close and careful analysis, informed by both social science and history."--<b>Joel Mokyr, Northwestern University</b></p> <p>"This is an outstanding book, painstaking and devastating in its attack on received wisdom, supported by a wealth of solid evidence and elegant argument."--<b>Jack A.

Organizing the product of Jews&#x2019; comic imagination over continents and centuries into what he calls the seven strands of Jewish comedy&#x2015;including the satirical, the witty, and the vulgar&#x2015;he traces the ways Jewish comedy has mirrored, and sometimes even shaped, the course of Jewish history. Persecution, cultural assimilation, religious revival, diaspora, Zionism&#x2015;all of these, and more, were grist for the Jewish comic mill; and Dauber&#x2019;s book takes readers on the tour of the funny side of some very serious business. (And vice versa.)</p><p>In a work of dazzling scope, readers will encounter comic masterpieces here that range from Talmudic rabbi jokes to medieval skits, Yiddish satires and Borscht Belt routines to scenes from <em>Seinfeld</em> and <em>Broad City</em>, and the book of Esther to Adam Sandler&#x2019;s &#x201c;Hanukkah Song.&#x201d; Dauber also explores the rise and fall of popular comic archetypes such as the Jewish mother, the Jewish American Princess, and the schlemiel, the schlimazel, and the schmuck, and the classic works of such masters of Jewish comedy as Sholem Aleichem, Isaac Babel, Franz Kafka, the Marx Brothers, Woody Allen, Joan Rivers, Philip Roth, Mel Brooks, Sarah Silverman, Jon Stewart, and Larry David, among many others.</p><p>Jewish comedy, as Dauber writes, is serious business.

The major change is the early and prominent coverage of modules, which the author extensively uses throughout. In addition, Paulson has totally rewritten the first chapter to make the book more accessible to students who have no experience of programming languages. The author describes the main features of new Standard Library for the revised version of ML, and gives many new examples, e.g. polynomial arithmetic and new ways of treating priority queues. Finally he has completely updated the references. Dr. Paulson has extensive practical experience of ML, and has stressed its use as a tool for software engineering; the book contains many useful pieces of code, which are freely available (via Internet) from the author. He shows how to use lists, trees, higher-order functions and infinite data structures. He includes many illustrative and practical examples, covering sorting, matrix operations, and polynomial arithmetic. He describes efficient functional implementations of arrays, queues, and priority queues. Larger examples include a general top-down parser, a lambda-calculus reducer and a theorem prover. A chapter is devoted to formal reasoning about functional programs. The combination of careful explanation and practical advice will ensure that this textbook continues to be the preferred text for many courses on ML for students at all levels.</p><p>The new edition of this successful and established textbook retains its two original intentions of explaining how to program in the ML language and teaching the fundamentals of functional programming.

How could their dreams come true? This little book proposes a different kind of communism, one that is true to its ideals and free from authoritarianism. Offering relief for many who have been numbed by Marxist exegesis and given headaches by the earnest pompousness of socialist politics, it presents political theory in the simple terms of a children's story, accompanied by illustrations of lovable little revolutionaries experiencing their political awakening.</p><p>It all unfolds like a story, with jealous princesses, fancy swords, displaced peasants, mean bosses, and tired workers&#x2013;not to mention a Ouija board, a talking chair, and a big pot called &#x201c;the state.&#x201d; Before they know it, readers are learning about the economic history of feudalism, class struggles in capitalism, different ideas of communism, and more. Finally, competition between two factories leads to a crisis that the workers attempt to solve in six different ways (most of them borrowed from historic models of communist or socialist change). Each attempt fails, since true communism is not so easy after all. But it's also not that hard. At last, the people take everything into their own hands and decide for themselves how to continue. Happy ending? Only the future will tell. With an epilogue that goes deeper into the theoretical issues behind the story, this book is perfect for all ages and all who desire a better world.</p></p><p>Bini Adamczak is a Berlin-based social theorist and artist. She writes on political theory, queer politics, and the past future of revolutions.Gr 9 Up&#x2014;A century after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Adamczak presents a fable of dystopian capitalism and various iterations of communism. The author, a German social theorist who writes on political theory and queer politics, relates her interpretation of the concept of capitalism in terms of princesses, queens, and maids&#x2014;and without becoming mired in historical detail. In fact, all of the charming illustrations of budding revolutionaries are of girls. In this tale of the drudgery of industrialization, the downtrodden become so disenchanted with capitalism that they decide communism will provide the solution to the evils they have suffered. Playing on Vladimir Lenin's political pamphlet "What is to Be Done?," the book describes six attempts at communism. Readers may find it worthwhile to try and identify the historical 20th-century movements each of these efforts represents. The translators ably reproduce Adamczak's light tone and storytelling voice. As in the original German edition (published in 2004), the epilogue moves on to a much more sophisticated analysis of what the author deems feasible, conceivable, and desirable for the future of communism. Although the English title indicates the book is for kids, Adamczak herself has said, "No, it's not. It's for everyone." VERDICT High school students interested in political theory will be challenged by this original presentation.&#x2014;Kate Reid, The Allen-Stevenson School, New York</p><h2>GF CONCEPTS AND CHALLENGES LIFE SCIENCE SE REVISED THIRD EDITION 1998C</h2><p>Concepts and Challenges in Life Science</p><p></p><h2>(Un)Qualified: How God Uses Broken People to Do Big Things</h2><p><b>Who you think you are is not as important as who God says you are...</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Many of us wrestle with the gap between our weaknesses and our dreams, between who we are and who God says we are meant to be. We feel unqualified to do God&#x2019;s work or to live out the calling we imagine. But God has a way of using our weaknesses for good. In fact, God loves unqualified people.<br>&nbsp;<br>In&nbsp;<i>(Un)Qualified,&nbsp;</i>Pastor Steven Furtick helps you peel back the assumptions you&#x2019;ve made about yourself and see yourself as God sees you. Because true peace and confidence come not from worldly perfection but from acceptance: God&#x2019;s acceptance of you, your acceptance of yourself, and your acceptance of God&#x2019;s process of change.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is a book about understanding your identity in light of who God is. It&#x2019;s a book about coming to terms with the good, the bad, and the unmentionable in your life and learning to let God use you. It&#x2019;s about charging into the gap between your present and your hopes and meeting God there. After all, God can&#x2019;t bless who you pretend to be. But he longs to bless who you really are; a flawed and broken person. Good thing for us that God is in the business of using broken people to do big things.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>&nbsp;Being unqualified is God's favorite qualification...</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>Our culture tells us that the answer to our failures is to fix them. The solution to our weaknesses is to hide them. The secret to our success is to appear as flawless as possible. But God&#x2019;s qualifying system is different than the world&#x2019;s. So is his view of our weaknesses, our purpose, and our true selves.<br>&nbsp;<br>In&nbsp;<i>(Un)Qualified,&nbsp;</i>Steven Furtick explores who God is as the great &#x201c;I AM,&#x201d; and then helps us discover our own identity. Delving into the story of Jacob, Furtick invites us to acknowledge our weaknesses and ask God to work through them.<br>&nbsp;<br>The truth is, God has created us to be more, to accomplish more, and to love life more than we ever thought possible. But to become who he has called us to be, we must embrace who we are right now.&nbsp;<i>(Un)Qualified&nbsp;</i>equips us to face obstacles and failures without losing a sense of purpose. We can have a thriving sense of hope that God is working in us and through us, not in spite of our weaknesses but often as a direct result of them.</p><p><b>Steven Furtick</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Sun Stand Still, Greater</i>, and <i>Crash the Chatterbox. </i>He is the founder and lead pastor of Elevation Church, which since its founding in 2006 has grown to more than twenty thousand attendees at twelve locations. He speaks at major conferences across the United States and around the world. Steven holds a master of divinity degree from Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. He and his wife, Holly, have three young children.&#x201c;What comes to your mind when you hear the name Steven&nbsp;Furtick?&#x201d; the interviewer asked the renowned theologian.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Hey, they&#x2019;re talking about me!&nbsp;</i><br><br>I sprinted back into the room where the video was playing,&nbsp;secretly excited to be the center of attention. I had read this guy&#x2019;s&nbsp;book about ministry in seminary, so I was rather flattered he knew&nbsp;my name. We had never even met.&nbsp;<br><br>I had found this particular interview the way you discover&nbsp;most YouTube videos&#x2014;by free-falling into the abyss that is the&nbsp;&#x201c;recommended for you&#x201d; sidebar. After I&#x2019;d clicked it, I&#x2019;d walked&nbsp;away to get dressed for church. I could still hear the interview in&nbsp;the background, but I wasn&#x2019;t really listening.&nbsp;<br><br>Until, out of nowhere, I heard that sweetest sound of all: my&nbsp;own name. It&#x2019;s always great to be recognized.&nbsp;<br><br>Except when it&#x2019;s not.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;What comes to your mind when you hear the name Steven&nbsp;Furtick?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>The theologian sighed and dropped his head, signifying that the mere consideration of my name was wearisome. That got the crowd chuckling. Apparently they knew he wasn&#x2019;t a fan.&nbsp;<br><br>Long, pained pause. Agonized grimace. Bone-chilling stare.&nbsp;<br><br>Then the verdict.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Unqualified.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>He delivered the four syllables with a disgust that underscored&nbsp;the gravity and finality of his pronouncement. Only the gavel&nbsp;sound effect was missing.&nbsp;<br><br>No elaboration. No explanation. No qualifiers. My whole life&nbsp;and ministry summed up with a single word.&nbsp;<br><br>And abruptly the interview moved on.&nbsp;<br><br>Unqualified?&nbsp;<br><br>That word started the wheels spinning in my head. It was&nbsp;strange because part of me wanted to come to my defense (against&nbsp;YouTube?), but the other part was thinking, Friend, you don&#x2019;t&nbsp;know the half of it.&nbsp;<br><br>Yes, I struggle&#x2014;with my temper, with my focus, with my&nbsp;motives, with my eating habits, with my prayer life, with my state&nbsp;of mind. And that list doesn&#x2019;t even scratch the surface.&nbsp;<br><br>I know my weaknesses and faults better than anyone. I don&#x2019;t&nbsp;need to listen to an online interview to feel disqualified. Hardly a&nbsp;day goes by that I&#x2019;m not seized by the sensation that I have no&nbsp;business doing what I&#x2019;m doing. That I&#x2019;m in over my head. That I&nbsp;don&#x2019;t deserve any of my blessings or opportunities.&nbsp;<br><br>Am I unqualified?&nbsp;<br><br>This book is the answer to that question. I&#x2019;m not writing it in&nbsp;reaction to that random interview on YouTube. I&#x2019;ve been asking&nbsp;myself that question my whole life. And maybe you have too.&nbsp;<br><br>When I started the journey that lies behind this book, I&nbsp;wanted to finally figure out how to respond to that question within&nbsp;myself. I wanted to know if that theologian was correct. If the&nbsp;whispers of doubt that regularly rattle through my head are inner&nbsp;demons to be ignored&#x2014;or warning bells to be heeded. If I should&nbsp;shoulder my responsibilities with confidence in my calling&#x2014;or&nbsp;panic and hide before I mess everything up.&nbsp;<br><br>At one point or another, you&#x2019;ve probably felt unqualified.&nbsp;Maybe you didn&#x2019;t have the dubious privilege of being informed of&nbsp;the fact via YouTube, but you knew it was true nonetheless.&nbsp;<br><br>I think we all secretly fight feelings of inadequacy, insufficiency,&nbsp;and incompetence. We wonder whether we really measure&nbsp;up. We fear we are not &#x201c;enough&#x201d;&#x2014;whatever that means in our&nbsp;particular situations.&nbsp;<br><br>Maybe it&#x2019;s in your character. There is a flaw, a crack, a deficiency&nbsp;that you try your hardest to hide. It could be lust. It could&nbsp;be anger. It could be addiction. Even if it&#x2019;s in the past, you may live&nbsp;in secret fear that one day it will come back in fury and destroy&nbsp;everything you are building.&nbsp;<br><br>Maybe it&#x2019;s in your role as a parent. At the workplace you have&nbsp;everything under control. You can buy and sell and trade with&nbsp;the best of them. But your home life is another story. You have no&nbsp;idea how to raise your teenager, and you are feeling dangerously&nbsp;unprepared.&nbsp;<br><br>Or maybe you know something deep in your soul is propelling&nbsp;you into ministry. Not necessarily full-time but definitely&nbsp;something significant. You are supposed to be a leader, a decision&nbsp;maker, a risktaker. But your track record is far from spotless. And&nbsp;<br>the thought of putting yourself out there is petrifying. What if you&nbsp;fail? And what if your failures shipwreck others along the way?&nbsp;<br><br>Many people live their entire lives fighting these contradictions.&nbsp;They deal constantly with voices in their heads telling them&nbsp;that they don&#x2019;t qualify, that they will never qualify, that they are&nbsp;totally, epically disqualified.&nbsp;<br><br>I wrote a book called Crash the Chatterbox about how to sort&nbsp;through negative thoughts. But this <br>book isn&#x2019;t about just changing&nbsp;what rattles around in our minds or what comes out of our&nbsp;mouths. <br>It&#x2019;s about understanding who we really are now in order&nbsp;to be who we are capable of becoming.&nbsp;It&#x2019;s about ruthlessly peeling&nbsp;back the prejudices and assumptions we&#x2019;ve made about ourselves.&nbsp;It&#x2019;s about letting God be our source of sufficiency.&nbsp;<br><br>I have good news. If you look at the great men and women of&nbsp;Scripture, you find one common denominator: they were all unqualified.&nbsp;God has a habit of picking people who have been passed&nbsp;over.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Pass or Fail&nbsp;</b><br><br>Have you ever thought about who&#x2014;or what&#x2014;truly has the ability&nbsp;to qualify you? Who has the ultimate right to determine if you&nbsp;are a success or a failure?&nbsp;<br><br>It&#x2019;s not as simple as it sounds.&nbsp;<br><br>For example, think about the first qualification system most&nbsp;of us experience in life: grades. Schools invest huge amounts of&nbsp;money and manpower into developing standards and tests. They&nbsp;<br>attempt to summarize students&#x2019; academic progress with a universal&nbsp;system of numbers or letters.&nbsp;<br><br>Maybe you&#x2019;ve been out of school for a while, but do you remember&nbsp;when your universe revolved around grades? Or maybe it&nbsp;didn&#x2019;t but your parents thought it should, in which case report-card day was probably terrifying. It was basically a preview of&nbsp;Judgment Day minus the cherubs and big white throne.&nbsp;<br><br>How did you feel when you got a passing grade? Probably&nbsp;relieved. Your parents were happy. Life was good again.&nbsp;<br><br>But think about it. Did that grade mean you learned the&nbsp;material? Or just that you were good at taking tests&#x2014;or maybe&nbsp;cheating on them? Even more important, did your grade mean&nbsp;you actually knew how to apply what you had learned?&nbsp;<br><br>Or maybe you got a failing grade. Did that mean you would&nbsp;fail in life? Did the fact that you dated the American Revolution&nbsp;before Columbus or forgot the quadratic equation or thought the&nbsp;periodic table had something to do with punctuation really doom&nbsp;you to an inferior existence?&nbsp;<br><br>Most of us have been around long enough to know that that&nbsp;little letter or number is important, but it&#x2019;s not the final word. Not&nbsp;even close. History is filled with successful academic dropouts,&nbsp;from Abraham Lincoln to Walt Disney to Bill Gates.&nbsp;<br><br>This whole business of judging and assessing and qualifying&nbsp;one another doesn&#x2019;t stop with school. It is deeply ingrained in our&nbsp;culture and psyche. Just look at our clich�s.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Pass the test.&nbsp;</i><br><i>Make the cut.&nbsp;</i><br><i>Fall short.&nbsp;</i><br><i>Measure up.&nbsp;</i><br><i>Make the grade.&nbsp;</i><br><i>Earn your stripes.&nbsp;</i><br><i>Pay your dues.&nbsp;</i><br><br>We constantly analyze and summarize each other. We compare&nbsp;people to our standards&#x2014;spoken or unspoken&#x2014;to see how&nbsp;they measure up. Then we accept them or reject them; we praise&nbsp;them or criticize them; we revere them or ridicule them. We all&nbsp;secretly administer exams in the university of our own opinions.&nbsp;<br><br>But just like grades in school, our evaluations don&#x2019;t usually tell&nbsp;the whole story. They are artificial, limited attempts to quantify&nbsp;something that can&#x2019;t really be reduced to a number, a letter, or a&nbsp;word.&nbsp;<br><br>But we keep trying. Because we&#x2019;re human, and that&#x2019;s what&nbsp;we do.&nbsp;<br><br>Basically, we tend to qualify people based on character and&nbsp;competency.&nbsp;<br><br>Character refers to who we are. Not just our names or nationalities,&nbsp;but our personalities, our morals, our values, our emotional&nbsp;makeup, our likes and dislikes, our tastes, our manners&#x2014;the list&nbsp;goes on.&nbsp;<br><br>Competency refers to what we do. It&#x2019;s the complex sum of&nbsp;our training, achievements, talents, activities, and potential. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;about how good we are at what we do and about how much we&nbsp;accomplish.&nbsp;<br><br>Our competency is usually much more at the forefront than&nbsp;our character. What we do makes headlines. It fills the pages of&nbsp;<br>our r�sum�s. It is so intricately connected to our identity that we&nbsp;often think it is our identity.&nbsp;<br><br>Sooner or later, though, our character gets the last laugh. People&nbsp;might hire us and use us for what we do, but they accept us&nbsp;and like us for who we are. And ultimately, of course, who we are&nbsp;determines what we do. You can pretend for only so long before&nbsp;the real you comes out.&nbsp;<br><br>The moment we meet a new person, we size up that person.&nbsp;We don&#x2019;t do this consciously for the most part. And it isn&#x2019;t necessarily&nbsp;meanspirited. We automatically gather clues about the&nbsp;other person&#x2019;s character and competency. We start to categorize&nbsp;the person in relationship to us.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Will we be friends? Am I interested in knowing this individual&nbsp;better, or should we just be casual acquaintances? Will he advance my&nbsp;career? Does she need my help? Is he a threat to me? Does she have&nbsp;something to offer me, or do I have something to offer her?&nbsp;</i><br><br>It would be easy to lament how selfish all this sounds and to&nbsp;make the case that our standards for others are so subjective and&nbsp;hypocritical they are laughable.&nbsp;<br><br>But I don&#x2019;t think that would really do humankind justice. Of&nbsp;course there are elements of subjectivity and self-centeredness in&nbsp;our relationships with others. That is part of life in a broken, fallen&nbsp;world. It is an instinct for self-preservation.&nbsp;<br><br>It&#x2019;s not realistic to expect people to accept each other at face&nbsp;value. Nor is it healthy to be naive and assume that everyone is our&nbsp;best friend or has our best interest at heart. That&#x2019;s why Jesus told&nbsp;us to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&nbsp;<br><br>But here&#x2019;s a point worth noting. We tend to be exceptionally&nbsp;<br>poor judges of other people. Have you noticed? And frankly we&nbsp;aren&#x2019;t even that good at judging ourselves.&nbsp;<br><br>That lack of accuracy, more than our tendency to assess others&nbsp;in the first place, is the problem.&nbsp;<br><br>I think that&#x2019;s what seemed kind of outrageous about the comments&nbsp;from my YouTube critic. <br>Where did this guy get his information?&nbsp;His standards? His authority?&nbsp;<br><br>I&#x2019;m not trying to judge his judgmentalism. That would be&nbsp;ironic. But I do have to decide how to react to it. And I don&#x2019;t mean&nbsp;my public response.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#x2019;m talking about something far more important: my internal&nbsp;response. How do I view myself? <br>How do I react to the criticism&nbsp;and assessments of a world obsessed with qualifications? How do&nbsp;I silence my own doubts, insecurities, and fears of failure?&nbsp;<br><br>The answer isn&#x2019;t what you would think. Or at least it wasn&#x2019;t&nbsp;what I thought when I started this journey.&nbsp;<br><br><b>The Qualification Trap&nbsp;</b><br><br>I used to think that the answer to my failures was to fix them, that&nbsp;the solution to my weaknesses was to replace them with strengths.&nbsp;I assumed the secret to success was to appear as perfect, flawless,&nbsp;and superhuman as possible. I concluded that my character and&nbsp;my competency qualified me or disqualified me.&nbsp;<br><br>But God&#x2019;s qualification system is much different from ours.&nbsp;And so is his way of approaching our weaknesses. Rather than&nbsp;stressing and obsessing over our lack, we need to find a different&nbsp;qualifier.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In the next few chapters, we are going to explore what it&nbsp;means to be qualified God&#x2019;s way. I believe it will revolutionize the&nbsp;way you see yourself and others. That&#x2019;s what it has done for me.&nbsp;<br><br>As you understand how God sees you, you will find the freedom&nbsp;and self-confidence that he wants for your life.&nbsp;<br>You will never get those things from human qualifications, by&nbsp;the way. That&#x2019;s a dead-end street. <br><br>You could never be perfect enough&nbsp;or failproof enough to be at peace with yourself on that basis alone.&nbsp;<br><br>Peace and confidence come through one thing: acceptance.&nbsp;In a culture fixated on self-improvement and self-help, that might&nbsp;seem counterintuitive. But it&#x2019;s true.&nbsp;<br><br>First, God&#x2019;s <i>unconditional acceptance of you</i>. God knows your&nbsp;true identity&#x2014;the real you&#x2014;and he loves you just as you are.&nbsp;<br><br>Second, your acceptance of yourself, including your weaknesses.&nbsp;That means confronting the parts of you that you may prefer to&nbsp;ignore. And it means knowing who you are (and who you are not)&nbsp;in and through Jesus.&nbsp;<br><br>And third, your acceptance of God&#x2019;s process of change. God&#x2019;s&nbsp;work in your life isn&#x2019;t meant to squelch or eradicate the real you&nbsp;but rather to bring out the best possible version of you.&nbsp;<br><br>Those three concepts&#x2014;identity, weakness, and change&#x2014;will&nbsp;show up again and again in this book because they are directly&nbsp;related to this issue of being qualified.&nbsp;<br><br>The three have a cyclical relationship. I know the &#x201c;real&nbsp;me&#x201d;&#x2014;my identity&#x2014;all too well. I know I have many weaknesses.&nbsp;That makes me feel unqualified, so I try to change my weaknesses.&nbsp;But reality soon sinks in. I can&#x2019;t completely fix myself. So&nbsp;my identity suffers even more, and I feel even less qualified.&nbsp;<br><br>As long as my answer to my lack of qualifications is just to try&nbsp;harder to qualify myself, I&#x2019;ll stay stuck in that cycle.&nbsp;<br><br>Has that ever happened to you? Do your failures ever shout so&nbsp;loudly you can&#x2019;t hear the opportunities? Do your self-doubts ever&nbsp;sabotage your success before you even get out of the gate?&nbsp;<br><br>The gap between who you are and what you want to accomplish&nbsp;can feel impossibly wide, and the question is left looming:&nbsp;<i>Am I qualified for this?&nbsp;</i><br><br>Now let me say this up-front&#x2014;that question is not the problem.&nbsp;You should ask yourself if you are qualified. Especially if you&nbsp;are trying to fly an airplane or perform open-heart surgery. In&nbsp;those cases, by all means, evaluate your training, your knowledge,&nbsp;your experience, and your abilities. <br>We will all thank you ...</p><h2>Tacopedia: The Taco Encyclopedia</h2><p><p><strong>Tacopedia is an encyclopaedic tribute to the vibrancy of Mexican taco culture.

What led to their creative leaps? Why did some succeed and others fail?<br> <br><i>The Innovators</i> is a masterly saga of collaborative genius destined to be the standard history of the digital revolution&#x2014;and an indispensable guide to how innovation really happens. Isaacson begins the adventure with Ada Lovelace, Lord Byron&#x2019;s daughter, who pioneered computer programming in the 1840s. He explores the fascinating personalities that created our current digital revolution, such as Vannevar Bush, Alan Turing, John von Neumann, J.C.R. Licklider, Doug Engelbart, Robert Noyce, Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs, Tim Berners-Lee, and Larry Page.<br> <br>This is the story of how their minds worked and what made them so inventive. It&#x2019;s also a narrative of how their ability to collaborate and master the art of teamwork made them even more creative. For an era that seeks to foster innovation, creativity, and teamwork, <i>The Innovators</i> is &#x201c;a sweeping and surprisingly tenderhearted history of the digital age&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times</i>).</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, October 2014:</strong> Many books have been written about Silicon Valley and the collection of geniuses, eccentrics, and mavericks who launched the &#x201c;Digital Revolution&#x201d;; Robert X. Cringely's <i>Accidental Empires</i> and Michael A. Hiltzik's <i>Dealers of Lightning</i> are just two excellent accounts of the unprecedented explosion of tech entrepreneurs and their game-changing success. But Walter Isaacson goes them one better: <i>The Innovators</i>, his follow-up to the massive (in both sales and size) <i>Steve Jobs</i>, is probably the widest-ranging and most comprehensive narrative of them all. Don't let the scope or page-count deter you: while Isaacson builds the story from the 19th century--innovator by innovator, just as the players themselves stood atop the achievements of their predecessors--his discipline and era-based structure allows readers to dip in and out of digital history, from Charles Babbage's Difference Engine, to Alan Turing and the codebreakers of Bletchley Park, to Tim Berners-Lee and the birth of the World Wide Web (with contextual nods to influential counterculture weirdos along the way). Isaacson's presentation is both brisk and illuminating; while it doesn't supersede previous histories, <i>The Innovators</i> might be the definitive overview, and it's certainly one hell of a read. --<i>Jon Foro</i></p>Walter Isaacson, University Professor of History at Tulane, has been CEO of the Aspen Institute, chairman of CNN, and editor of&nbsp;<i>Time</i>&nbsp;magazine.

Most students enrolled in this course have taken general chemistry, organic chemistry, and a year of physics and calculus. Only basic skills of differential and integral calculus are required for understanding the equations. For premedical students, this text will form the basis for taking courses like physiology in medical school. For those intending to pursue graduate study in biosciences, the material presented here will serve as an introduction to topics in biophysical chemistry courses, where more advanced texts such as those by Gennis, van Holde, and Cantor &amp; Schimmel are used. The author's aim is to emphasize understanding physical concepts rather than focus on precise mathematical development or on actual experimental details.

When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway. The couple had three children&#x2014;an older daughter Susanna and twins, Judith and Hamnet. Hamnet, Shakespeare&#x2019;s only son, died in childhood. The bulk of Shakespeare&#x2019;s working life was spent in the theater world of London, where he established himself professionally by the early 1590s. He enjoyed success not only as a playwright and poet, but also as an actor and shareholder in an acting company. Although some think that sometime between 1610 and 1613 Shakespeare retired from the theater and returned home to Stratford, where he died in 1616, others believe that he may have continued to work in London until close to his death.<br><br>Barbara A.

Its pictures are sure to snare the substantial audience interested in the history of swords, guns, and body armor. Limiting the subject to portable armaments, the work extends from the first likely weapon (a rock) to the rifles issued to contemporary infantrymen. In most cases, the emphasis is on the tools of the ordinary soldier, his equipage through time explained with arrowed illustrations. The evolution of handheld weaponry is soon apparent, with that of firearms especially prominent. Some guns depicted here will be recognizable (think AK-47) even to those who recoil from guns. Explaining how such lethal equipment works is <i>Weapon</i>'s forte; another asset is the comparison of weapon categories across a suite of historical societies. Popular?

Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or private life.

She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer, and they had one son together, Richard.<p><strong>Excerpt from Chapter One</strong></p> <p>Miss Allison thought that Silas Kane's sixtieth birthday party was going off rather better than anyone had imagined it would. Such family gatherings &#x2014; for the Mansells, through long business partnership with Silas, might almost be ranked as relatives &#x2014; were, in Miss Allison's sage opinion, functions to be attended in a spirit of considerable trepidation. Nor had this one promised well at its inception. To begin with, Silas was at polite variance with old Joseph Mansell. Their disagreement was purely on a matter of business, but although Joseph Mansell, a husband and a father, had existence outside the offices of Kane and Mansell, Silas and his business were one and indivisible. He was not, at the best of times, a man who contributed largely to the gaiety of an evening party. He was invariably civil, in an old-world style that seemed to suit his neat little imperial and the large stock-ties he wore, and he would listen as patiently to a discussion on Surr�alism as to the description of the bird life on the Farne Islands which was being imparted to him at the moment by Agatha Mansell. Both subjects bored him, but he inclined his head with an assumption of interest, smiled kindly and coldly, and said Indeed! or Is that so? at the proper moments.</p> <p>Miss Allison, glancing from his thin, pale face, with its austere mouth and its calm, aloof eyes, to Mrs Mansell's countenance, wondered whether a realisation of her host's complete indifference to her conversation would shake Agatha Mansell's magnificent assurance. Probably it would not. Mrs Mansell had been to college in the days when such a distinction earned for a woman the title of Blue-Stocking and the right to think herself superior to her less fortunate sisters. She had preserved through thirty years this pleasant feeling of superiority and an alarmingly cultured voice which could make itself heard without the least vulgar effort above any number of less commanding accents.</p> <p>'We were disappointed at seeing no gunnets,' announced Mrs Mansell. 'Of course, when we were on Ionah last year we saw hundreds of gunnets.'</p> <p>'Ah, is that so indeed?' said Silas Kane.<br> 'I saw a film about a lot of gannets once,' suddenly remarked young Mr Harte. He added disparagingly: 'It wasn't too bad.'</p> <p>Neither Silas nor Mrs Mansell paid any heed to this contribution to the conversation, and young Mr Harte, who was rising fifteen, returned unabashed to the rending of a drum-stick.</p> <p>Young Mr Harte was not really a member of the family, but his mother, by reason of her first marriage with Silas's nephew James, ranked in the Kanes' estimation as a Kane. James had been killed in the Great War, and although the Kanes bore no ill-will towards Sir Adrian Harte, they could never understand why Norma, who was left in comfortable circumstances, had taken it into her head to marry him. </p> <p>Neither Norma nor Sir Adrian was present at this gathering. Norma, who had developed in her thirties a passion for penetrating into the more inaccessible parts of the world, was believed to be amongst pygmies and gorillas in the Belgian Congo, and Sir Adrian, though invited to the party, had excused himself with a vague and graceful plea of a previous engagement. He had sent in his stead, however, his son Timothy, in charge of Jim Kane, his stepson, who was even now trying to catch Miss Allison's eye over the bank of flowers in the middle of the table.</p> <p>Timothy had come to stay. Jim had brought him down in his cream-coloured sports car with a charming note from Sir Adrian. Sir Adrian had providentially remembered that Silas, upon the occasion of Timothy's last visit, had said that he must come again whenever he liked and for as long as he liked, and Sir Adrian, confronted by the task of amusing his son during the eight weeks of his summer holidays, decided that the day of Timothy's liking to visit Cliff House again had dawned. Miss Allison, sedately avoiding Jim Kane's eye, wondered what young Mr Harte would find to do in a household containing herself in attendance upon an old lady of over eighty years, and Silas Kane. He enlightened her. 'Are there any decent films on in Portlaw this month, Miss Allison?' he inquired. 'I don't mean muck about love and that sort of thing, but really good films, with G men and gangsters and things.'</p> <p>Miss Allison confessed ignorance, but said that she would obtain a list of the entertainments offered.</p> <p>'Oh, thanks, awf'ly; but I can easily buzz into Portlaw on my bike,' said Mr Harte. 'I sent it by train, and I dare say it'll be at the station now, though actually when you send things by train they don't arrive until years after you do.' He refreshed himself with a draught of ginger beer, and added with a darkling look across the table: 'As a matter of fact, it was complete drivel sending it by train at all; but some people seem to think nothing matters but their own rotten paint-work.'</p> <p>Jim Kane, at whom this embittered remark was levelled, grinned amiably, and recommended his half-brother to put a sock in it.</p> <p>Miss Allison glanced down the long table to where her employer was seated. Old Mrs Kane, who was over eighty, had been carried downstairs to grace her son's birthday party, not against her wishes (for she would have thought it impossible that any function should be held at Cliff House without her), but firmly denying any expectation of enjoyment. 'I shall have Joseph Mansell on my right and Clement on my left,' she decreed.</p> <p>Miss Allison, who filled the comprehensive role of companion-secretary to Emily Kane, ventured to suggest that more congenial dinner partners might be found than the two selected by her employer. </p> <p>'It is Joe Mansell's right to take the seat of honour,' responded Mrs Kane bleakly. 'And Clement is senior to Jim.'</p> <p>So there was Emily Kane, sitting very upright in her chair at the end of the table, with Joe Mansell, a heavy man with gross features and a hearty laugh, seated on one side of her, and on the other, her great-nephew Clement, the very antithesis of Joe Mansell, but equally displeasing to her.</p></p><h2>Writing First with Readings: Practice in Context</h2><p>Best-selling authors and veteran college writing instructors Laurie Kirszner and Stephen Mandell believe that students learn to write best when they use their own writing as a starting point.

Russia in the 1840s. There is a stranger in town, and he is behaving oddly. The unctuous Pavel Chichikov goes around the local estates buying up dead souls . These are the papers relating to serfs who have died since the last census, but who remain on the record and still attract a tax demand. Chichikov is willing to relieve their owners of the tax burden by buying the titles for a song. What he does not say is that he then proposes to take out a huge mortgage against these fictitious citizens and buy himself a nice estate in Eastern Russia. Will he get away with it? Who will rumble him? Does this narrative contain a deeper message about Russia itself or the spiritual health of humanity? There is much interest and some suspense in considering these issues, but the real pleasure of this story lies elsewhere. It is an enjoyable comic romp through a retarded part of a backward country, a picaresque series of grotesque portraits, situations and conversations described with Gogolian humour based mainly on hyperbole. This is, quite simply, the funniest book in the Russian language before the twentieth century.</p><p>Since its publication in 1842, <b>Dead Souls</b> has been celebrated as a supremely realistic portrait of provincial Russian life and as a splendidly exaggerated tale; as a paean to the Russian spirit and as a remorseless satire of imperial Russian venality, vulgarity, and pomp. As Gogol's wily antihero, Chichikov, combs the back country wheeling and dealing for "dead souls"--deceased serfs who still represent money to anyone sharp enough to trade in them--we are introduced to a Dickensian cast of peasants, landowners, and conniving petty officials, few of whom can resist the seductive illogic of Chichikov's proposition.

Meanwhile, the Master, author of an unpublished novel about Jesus and Pontius Pilate, languishes in despair in a pyschiatric hospital, while his devoted lover, Margarita, decides to sell her soul to save him. As Bulgakov&#x2019;s dazzlingly exuberant narrative weaves back and forth between Moscow and ancient Jerusalem, studded with scenes ranging from a giddy Satanic ball to the murder of Judas in Gethsemane, Margarita&#x2019;s enduring love for the Master joins the strands of plot across space and time.</p></p><p>Surely no stranger work exists in the annals of protest literature than <i>The Master and Margarita</i>. Written during the Soviet crackdown of the 1930s, when Mikhail Bulgakov's works were effectively banned, it wraps its anti-Stalinist message in a complex allegory of good and evil. Or would that be the other way around? The book's chief character is Satan, who appears in the guise of a foreigner and self-proclaimed black magician named Woland. Accompanied by a talking black tomcat and a "translator" wearing a jockey's cap and cracked pince-nez, Woland wreaks havoc throughout literary Moscow. First he predicts that the head of noted editor Berlioz will be cut off; when it is, he appropriates Berlioz's apartment. (A puzzled relative receives the following telegram: "Have just been run over by streetcar at Patriarch's Ponds funeral Friday three afternoon come Berlioz.") Woland and his minions transport one bureaucrat to Yalta, make another one disappear entirely except for his suit, and frighten several others so badly that they end up in a psychiatric hospital. In fact, it seems half of Moscow shows up in the bin, demanding to be placed in a locked cell for protection. <p> Meanwhile, a few doors down in the hospital lives the true object of Woland's visit: the author of an unpublished novel about Pontius Pilate. This Master--as he calls himself--has been driven mad by rejection, broken not only by editors' harsh criticism of his novel but, Bulgakov suggests, by political persecution as well. Yet Pilate's story becomes a kind of parallel narrative, appearing in different forms throughout Bulgakov's novel: as a manuscript read by the Master's indefatigable love, Margarita, as a scene dreamed by the poet--and fellow lunatic--Ivan Homeless, and even as a story told by Woland himself. Since we see this narrative from so many different points of view, who is truly its author? Given that the Master's novel and this one end the same way, are they in fact the same book? These are only a few of the many questions Bulgakov provokes, in a novel that reads like a set of infinitely nested Russian dolls: inside one narrative there is another, and then another, and yet another. His devil is not only entertaining, he is <i>necessary</i>: "What would your good be doing if there were no evil, and what would the earth look like if shadows disappeared from it?"</p><p> Unsurprisingly--in view of its frequent, scarcely disguised references to interrogation and terror--Bulgakov's masterwork was not published until 1967, almost three decades after his death. Yet one wonders if the world was really ready for this book in the late 1930s, if, indeed, we are ready for it now. Shocking, touching, and scathingly funny, it is a novel like no other. Woland may reattach heads or produce 10-ruble notes from the air, but Bulgakov proves the true magician here. <i>The Master and Margarita</i> is a different book each time it is opened. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>The devil, disguised as a magician, descends upon Moscow in the 1930s with his riotous band, which includes a talking cat and an expert assassin. Together they succeed in comically befuddling a population which denies the devil&#39;s existence, even as it is confronted with the diabolic results of a magic act gone wrong. This visit to the capital of world atheism has several aims, one of which concerns the fate of the Master, a writer who has written a novel about Pontius Pilate, and is now in a mental hospital. Margarita, the despairing and daring heroine, becomes a witch in an effort to save the Master, and agrees to become the devil&#39;s hostess at his annual spring ball. By turns acidly satiric, fantastic, and ironically philosophical, this work constantly surprises and entertains, as the action switches back and forth between the Moscow of the 1930s and first-century Jerusalem.</p><h2>Bad Faith: When Religious Belief Undermines Modern Medicine</h2><p><br>In recent years, there have been major outbreaks of whooping cough among children in California, mumps in New York, and measles in Ohio's Amish country&#x2014;despite the fact that these are all vaccine-preventable diseases. Although America is the most medically advanced place in the world, many people disregard modern medicine in favor of using their faith to fight life threatening illnesses. Christian Scientists pray for healing instead of going to the doctor, Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions, and ultra-Orthodox Jewish mohels spread herpes by using a primitive ritual to clean the wound. Tragically, children suffer and die every year from treatable diseases, and in most states it is legal for parents to deny their children care for religious reasons. In twenty-first century America, how could this be happening?<br><br>In <i>Bad Faith</i>, acclaimed physician and author Dr. Paul Offit gives readers a never-before-seen look into the minds of those who choose to medically martyr themselves, or their children, in the name of religion. Offit chronicles the stories of these faithful and their children, whose devastating experiences highlight the tangled relationship between religion and medicine in America. Religious or not, this issue reaches everyone&#x2014;whether you are seeking treatment at a Catholic hospital or trying to keep your kids safe from diseases spread by their unvaccinated peers.<br><br>Replete with vivid storytelling and complex, compelling characters, <i>Bad Faith</i> makes a strenuous case that denying medicine to children in the name of religion isn't just unwise and immoral, but a rejection of the very best aspects of what belief itself has to offer.<br></p><p><b>Paul A. Offit, MD</b>, is a Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The author of several books, he lives in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.An important and fascinating book. For more than a decade, Paul Offit has been relentless in his exposure of forces that can undermine the life-saving advances of modern medicine. His latest effort, <i>Bad Faith</i>, combines gripping storytelling with an insider's knowledge. Offit offers a compassionate and clear-headed take on religion that puts children's well-being where it should be: at the center of the discussion. A must-read for anyone interested in the challenges of public health in the twenty-first century.&#x201d;<br> Seth Mnookin, Associate Director of The Graduate Program in Science Writing, MIT, and author of <i>The Panic Virus: The True Story Behind the Vaccine-Autism Controversy</i><br><br><b>PRAISE FOR <i>BAD FAITH</i>:</b><br><br><b>One of Library Journal's Best Core Nonfiction&#x201d; books of 2015</b><br><br> Gripping.... With <i>Bad Faith</i>, perhaps even more than with his previous books, Dr. Offit is probably preaching only to the choir. That doesn't make his message any less important.&#x201d;<br> <i>New York Times, Science Times</i><br><br> Offit must be commended for the detachment and gentleness with which he treats his subjects, who comprise both the faith healers and the parents of children who have died because they failed to receive life-saving medical procedures...He treads a careful path through exposing the wretchedness caused by religion, while not simply applauding secularism as the remedy.&#x201d;<br> <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i><br><br> But even allowing for the positive role of religion in aiding the afflicted, one can only hope that...books like <i>Bad Faith</i> will eventually bring about legislation that eliminates religious exemption for medical neglect of a child.&#x201d;<br> <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> Offit nobly endeavours to make peace with religion as concept, while simultaneously lambasting its more blinkered, potentially dangerous practitioners.<br> <i>Globe &amp; Mail</i><br><br><br> Paul Offit is one of the most courageous and sober voices arguing to protect children from exemptions made by their parents.&#x201d;<br> <i>New York Review of Books</i><br><br> Offit is unflinching in his examination of the lethal costs of belief taken to irrational extremes.&#x201d;<br> <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> A thought-provoking discussion of the conflict between society's right to protect all children and the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom.&#x201d;<br> <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> Offit makes a convincing case that these actions are contrary to the very best aspects inherent in religious beliefs.&#x201d;<br> <i>Muses &amp; Visionaries</i><br><br> This is a brave examination of the unhappy borderlands where religious beliefs battle often tragically against the imperatives of medical care and public health; packed with fascinating stories of the most tortured meetings of medical practice and religious practice, but also allowing glimpses of good faith and medical hope.&#x201d;<br> Perri Klass, M.D., Director, Arthur L. Carter Institute of Journalism, New York University and author of <i>Treatment Kind and Fair</i><br><br> No physician today writes with more passion and courage about the impact of quackery, zealotry, hucksterism, and bad science upon the health of our children than Paul Offit. <i>Bad Faith</i> is another superb example, exposing the dangers of religious extremism in denying basic and life-saving medical care to the most vulnerable among us. This is no screed against religion, far from it. Deeply moving, elegantly written, <i>Bad Faith</i> brilliantly exposes the harm done by belief systems gone awry.&#x201d;<br> David Oshinsky, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for <i>Polio: An American Story</i> and Director, Division of Medical Humanities, New York University Medical School<br><br> The medical system may function, in many ways, like an organized religion, but Paul Offit is not asking us to abandon God for doctors. Nor is he arguing that faith is bad. His premise here is that both medicine and religion, at their best, hold human life sacred.&#x201d;<br> Eula Biss, author of <i>On Immunity: An Inoculation</i><br><br> Honest and fair, <i>Bad Faith</i> fails to leave any stone unturned whether it be why faith-healing groups continue to promote these practices or roots of the religious theories against modern science. Regardless of your faith, this is a fabulous book that's well worth the read.&#x201d;<br> <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i><br><br> Using actual case histories to illustrate the needless suffering and deaths that occur as a result of these methods, Offit masterfully points out that the denial of medicine in the name of religion actually rejects the basic teaching of religious faith: relieving suffering, providing hope, and treating others as one would wish to be treated. An excellent book with an important message that belongs in all library collections.<br> <i>Library Journal</i> (starred review)<br><br> A clear-eyed, sometimes terrifying look at how religious belief has been used, both historically and in contemporary contexts, to undermine modern medicine.&#x201d;<br> <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (feature interview)<br><br> A must read for anyone who seeks to understand the tangled relationship between religion and medicine in America.&#x201d;<br> <i>Shot of Prevention</i><br><br> This book should be read by anyone who deals with children, parents, medicine, or religion Read the book. Make up your own mind about the religious aspect of it.

With an unparalleled number of illustrations and contextual materials, accessible and engaging introductions, and full explanatory annotations, the concise edition of this acclaimed Broadview anthology provides focused yet wide-ranging coverage for British literature survey courses. Highlights of Volume B include: substantial excerpts from Thomas DeQuincey&#39;s Confessions of an English Opium Eater; a &#34;Contexts&#34; section on &#34;India and the Orient&#34; highlighting the effects of imperial expansion on British society and on the Romantic imagination; the complete text of Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#39;s In Memoriam A.H.H.; Vernon Lee&#39;s short story &#34;The Virgin of the Seven Daggers&#34;; Augusta Webster&#39;s &#34;A Castaway&#34;; George Bernard Shaw&#39;s Mrs Warren&#39;s Profession, annotated by Leonard Conolly; and a large selection of late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century writers including Alice Munro, Angela Carter, Kazuo Ishiguro, Seamus Heaney, Carol Anne Duffy, and Ngugi wa Thiong&#39;o.</p><p>General Editors: Joseph Black, University of Massachusetts Leonard Conolly, Trent University Kate Flint, Rutgers University Isobel Grundy, University of Alberta Don LePan, Broadview Press Roy Liuzza, University of Tennessee Jerome J.

Qualls, Rutgers University Claire Waters, University of California, Davis"Broadview&#x2019;s recent Anthology of British Literature is an exciting achievement. Broadview has accomplished what no other anthology to date has been able to do. In its selection of materials, the anthology successfully integrates significant but only recently acknowledged works alongside more familiar greats. Its introductory essays and useful appendices successfully reflect current scholarship while remaining student centered. ... With an impressive selection of literary works, an equally impressive collection of visual images, and an exemplary emphasis on print culture and history of the language, The Broadview Anthology not only rivals the Norton and the Longman, it sets a new standard by which all other anthologies of British literature will now have to be measured." - Graham Hammill, University of Notre Dame "The simple fact is that a major work of student-centered scholarship has arrived in the field of English studies, and The Broadview Anthology of British Literature is no mere pretender to the throne long held by the Norton: it is the new standard." - Richard Nordquist, Armstrong Atlantic State University "With the publication of The Broadview Anthology of British Literature, teachers and students in survey and upper-level undergraduate courses have a compelling alternative to the established anthologies from Norton and Longman. Having adopted the first two volumes for an early period survey course last year, I had no hesitation in repeating the experience this year. The medieval volume, in particular, is superb, with its generous representation of Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman literary culture, as well as its growing collection of texts from the too little-known fifteenth century. This is a very real intellectual, as well as pedagogical, achievement." - Nicholas Watson, Harvard University "The plain fact is that [the Broadview] has no serious or up-to-date competition. And you can quote me!" - John Rempel, University of Manitoba "The Broadview Anthology of British Literature promises to be a top competitor with similar volumes, such as the Norton and the Longman, and deservedly so. The section on Shakespeare is excellent...I regard the unhesitating confrontation with the difficulties of King Lear that is shown by the Broadview editors as a microcosmic illustration of the toughness, determination, and conscientiousness of the editors throughout this entire British literature anthology." - Robert H.

It had never happened before in the country's history - and it would not happen again until 1940.<br><br>Into the void left by this domestic catastrophe, strode one of the most remarkable rulers of the age, Henry V of England, the victor of Agincourt, who conquered much of northern France before dying at the age of thirty-six, just two months before he would have become King of France.<br><br>Following on from <i>Divided Houses (</i>winner of the Wolfson History Prize and shortlisted for the Hessel-Tiltman), <i>Cursed Kings</i> is the magisterial new chapter in 'one of the great historical works of our time' (Allan Massie).</p><p>Jonathan Sumption is a former History Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and a practising QC.

She has since done both, and even when she's recounting a dirty joke, she can't help but employ a poet's precise and musical vision. Her first memoir, <i>The Liar's Club</i>, was as searing a chronicle of family life as can be imagined--tough, funny, and crackling with sorrow and wit. Against all odds, its sequel doesn't disappoint. <i>Cherry</i> finds the teenage Mary still marooned in a family whose behavior ranges from charmingly eccentric to dangerously crazy. (This, for instance, is the Karr version of a note from home: "Lecia Karr's leprosy kicked in, and I had to wrap her limbs in balm and hyssop. Please excuse her.") But here the focus has shifted to Mary herself, furiously engaged in pissing off authority at every turn: flouting the dress code, dropping acid, running from the cops, falling in love. <p> First love, you may say, heart sinking in chest: what more can possibly be said about such a subject? Actually, a great deal. To read <i>Cherry</i> is to realize how rare it is to find a teenage girl portrayed on her own terms. As a chronicle of female adolescence with all its longings, fantasies, cruelties, and fears, Karr's memoir goes darker and deeper than any book in which the protagonist doesn't end up dead. She turns a savage eye on her own hypocrisies and failings, and we like her all the more for them. We even end up fond of Leechfield, easily the toughest, smelliest, nastiest little burg ever to appear between the covers of a book--"a town too ugly not to love," her father called it in <i>The Liar's Club</i>. Growing up in such a place is necessarily about getting the hell out, but it's also about inventing a new identity with which to make your escape. That's the blessing Karr's wise friend Meredith bestows after a particularly harrowing (and harrowingly funny) acid trip: "I see big adventures for Mary. Big adventures, long roads, great oceans: same self." <i>Cherry</i> is the story of how Karr begins to acquire that self, however fumblingly--a big adventure for Mary, as it is for all of us, and one we never finish as long as we live. Perhaps that's the book's greatest pleasure of all: it hints there's more to come. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory</h2><p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Presents a comprehensive theory of human motivation and action from a social-cognitive perspective.

Set in the years leading up to the First World War, the work is an elegy, not just for an individual character, but for a generation lost in and affected by the war.This Shakespeare Head Press edition restores the text to its original form, notably recreating the space breaks on the page with which Woolf deliberately fragmented her narrative. The editor provides an extensive introduction, discussing the genesis of the novel, its biographical elements, the process of composition and revision, and the history of its early critical reception. A series of notes helps the reader to identify references and allusions, from sponge-bag trousers and gold beaters skin to Tonks and Steer, and the Hampstead Garden Suburbs; while an appendix lists variants between the first UK and first US editions of the work.Virginia Woolf's first original and distinguished work, <i>Jacob's Room</i> is the story of a sensitive young man named Jacob Flanders. The life story, character and friends of Jacob are presented in a series for separate scenes and moments from his childhood, through college at Cambridge, love affairs in London, and travels in Greece, to his death in the war. <i>Jacob's Room</i> established Virginia Woolf's reputation as a highly poetic and symbolic writer who places emphasis not on plot or action but on the psychological realm of occupied by her characters.</p><h2>Criminal Evidence</h2><p>With an emphasis on real-world applications, CRIMINAL EVIDENCE, Eighth Edition, provides readers with comprehensive, up-to-date coverage of common evidentiary topics in a brief, affordable format.

Having bid farewell to her pupils at Fairacre School, Miss Read finds herself as busy and in demand as ever, on holiday in Florence, helping with church and school affairs, and offering a kindly ear to her often eccentric neighbors. Soon she is counseling Henry Mawne on his thorny marriage, gently resisting her own perennial suitor, John Jenkins, and, finally, discovering her talent for writing. Once again, Miss Read&#39;s affection for the minutiae of village life, her love of nature, and her good humor make her excellent company. Miss Read&#39;s many fans will have more to look forward to: the author will continue to add to her Thrush Green series of novels.</p><p>Miss Read is the pseudonym of Mrs. Dora Saint, a former schoolteacher beloved for her novels of English rural life, especially those set in the fictional villages of Thrush Green and Fairacre. The first of these, Village School, was published in 1955, and Miss Read continued to write until her retirement in 1996. In the 1998, she was awarded an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for her services to literature. She lives in Berkshire.Miss Read's books are like comfort food for the soul. The stories are wholesome, familiar and untroubling. In this story Miss Read leaves her job as schoolmistress of Fairacre School and settles down to retired life. She receives advice, volunteer work, writing assignments and the opportunity to be a marriage counselor. Sian Phillips, the distinguished actress, reads the story in a thoroughly professional, cultured manner. Hers is a solid, determined Miss Read and not a frail old lady who simply rests and roams about her gardens. For those seeking to return in spirit to a simpler place, this story about retirement in a Cotswold village is just the thing. D.L.G.

This Penguin Classics edition brings together a dozen of the master's tales-from his early short stories "Under the Pyramids" (originally ghostwritten for Harry Houdini) and "The Music of Erich Zann" (which Lovecraft ranked second among his own favorites) through his more fully developed works, "The Dunwich Horror," The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, and <i>At the Mountains of Madness</i>.<br><br><b><i><b>The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories</b> </i></b>presents the definitive corrected texts of these works, along with Lovecraft critic and biographer S. T. Joshi's illuminating introduction and notes to each story.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p><b>H. P. Lovecraft</b>&nbsp;was born in 1890 in Providence, Rhode Island, where he lived most of his life. Frequent illnesses in his youth disrupted his schooling, but Lovecraft gained a wide knowledge of many subjects through independent reading and study. He wrote many essays and poems early in his career, but gradually focused on the writing of horror stories, after the advent in 1923 of the pulp magazine&nbsp;<i>Weird Tales</i>, to which he contributed most of his fiction. His relatively small corpus of fiction&#x2014;three short novels and about sixty short stories&#x2014;has nevertheless exercised a wide influence on subsequent work in the field, and he is regarded as the leading twentieth-century American author of supernatural fiction. H. P. Lovecraft died in Providence in 1937.<br><br><b>S. T. Joshi</b>&nbsp;is a freelance writer and editor. He has edited Penguin Classics editions of H. P. Lovecraft&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories</i>&nbsp;(1999), and&nbsp;<i>The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories</i>&nbsp;(2001), as well as Algernon Blackwood&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Ancient Sorceries and Other Strange Stories</i>&nbsp;(2002). Among his critical and biographical studies are&nbsp;<i>The Weird Tale</i>(1990),&nbsp;<i>Lord Dunsany: Master of the Anglo-Irish Imagination</i>&nbsp;(1995),&nbsp;<i>H. P.

Now, 17 years since the last edition, the Companion is here to serve a new generation of students, teachers, performers, concert goers, record collectors, and music lovers.<br> Completely revised and updated by a distinguished team of contributors, the <em>Oxford Companion to Music</em> features more than 1,000 new entries than the previous edition; more than 70 percent of the entire text is either new or entirely rewritten. Here, in articles that range from clear, concise definitions of musical ideas and terms to extended surveys of musical forms and styles, is authoritative coverage of virtually every musical subject. Embracing the world of music in all its variety--including jazz, popular music, and dance--the <em>Companion</em> offers a concentrated focus on the Western classic tradition, from the Middle Ages to the present day.<br> More than 8,000 articles sweep across an extraordinary range of subjects: composers, performers, conductors, individual works, instruments and notation, forms and genres. From the study of music--theory, aesthetics, scholarship--to the way it is performed and disseminated, the <em>Companion</em> provides comprehensive, accessible coverage of music in all its artistic, historical, cultural, and social dimensions.<br>Comprehensive, authoritative, up-to-date, and designed throughout for clarity and accessibility, the new <em>Oxford Companion to Music,</em> like every edition before it, will immediately become an indispensable resource for all who wish to enrich their love and knowledge of music.<br></p><p><br><strong>Alison Latham</strong> is a well-known editor of music reference works. She has edited <em>The Musical Times</em> and for over ten years was publications editor at the Royal Opera House, Convent Garden. She was assistant editor of <em>The Grove Concise Dictionary of Music</em> and the co-editor of <em>The Cambridge Guide to Music</em> and <em>Verdi in Performance.</em><br>The new <i>Oxford Companion to Music</i> updates two earlier works: the original 1938 <i>Companion,</i> last published in 1970, and <i>The New Oxford Companion to Music</i>, a two-volume set published in 1983. Its focus is classical music from the Middle Ages to the present. In the preface, editor Latham notes that "non-Western and popular musics are included, but mostly in so far as they have had an impact on the Western classical tradition." According to the jacket blurb, there are more than 1,000 (out of more than 8,000 total) new entries, and more than 70 percent of the content has been revised or rewritten. Well over 100 scholars and writers contributed to this edition.<p>Entries, arranged alphabetically, vary in length from one or two lines <i>(Orchestral score; Rite of Spring, The)</i> to several pages <i>(Copyright; Form; Handel, George Frideric; Pianoforte</i>). Biographies (of composers, artists, etc.), instruments, well-known works, countries, societies, musical terms and types, and sociocultural aspects <i>(Music on the Internet, Politics and music</i>) are all covered. Nine major multipage essays on topics such as "The Baroque Era" and "Opera" are printed on a light gray background and arranged in sections. Some are new; some are repeats from the <i>New Oxford</i> with necessary revisions. Some entries show the British origin of the work, such as <i>Eighth-</i> note, defined as the American term for <i>quaver.</i> Tables and examples of notation are added where needed, but the photographs, portraits, and reproductions of paintings and scores found in the <i>New Oxford</i> have been omitted. The writing is accessible to a wide range of users, from students and professional musicians to the general reader and listener.</p><p>Libraries that own <i>Baker's Dictionary of Music</i> (Schirmer, 1997), which is somewhat similar in scope and size, will want to purchase this as well, because each title has many unique entries. In general, although <i>Baker's</i> has more references to popular music, <i>Oxford</i> includes more scholarly and technical detail as well as bibliographic references that have been expanded from other editions. This will be a standard purchase for smaller libraries that want to update the classical music section with a reasonably priced, one-volume work. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But questions about the categories of "art" and "art history" acquired increased urgency during the 1970s, when new developments in critical theory and other intellectual projects dramatically transformed the discipline. The first edition of <i>Critical Terms for Art History</i> both mapped and contributed to those transformations, offering a spirited reassessment of the field's methods and terminology.<br><br>Art history as a field has kept pace with debates over globalization and other social and political issues in recent years, making a second edition of this book not just timely, but crucial. Like its predecessor, this new edition consists of essays that cover a wide variety of "loaded" terms in the history of art, from <i>sign</i> to <i>meaning</i>, <i>ritual</i> to <i>commodity</i>. Each essay explains and comments on a single term, discussing the issues the term raises and putting the term into practice as an interpretive framework for a specific work of art. For example, Richard Shiff discusses "Originality" in Vija Celmins's <i>To Fix the Image in Memory</i>, a work made of eleven pairs of stones, each consisting of one "original" stone and one painted bronze replica. <br><br>In addition to the twenty-two original essays, this edition includes nine new ones&#x2014;<i>performance</i>, <i>style</i>, <i>memory/monument</i>, <i>body</i>, <i>beauty</i>, <i>ugliness</i>, <i>identity</i>, <i>visual culture/visual studies</i>, and <i>social history of art</i>&#x2014;as well as new introductory material. All help expand the book's scope while retaining its central goal of stimulating discussion of theoretical issues in art history and making that discussion accessible to both beginning students and senior scholars.<br><br>Contributors: Mark Antliff, Nina Athanassoglou-Kallmyer, Stephen Bann, Homi K.

Terms such as representation, originality, appropriation, gaze, and commodity are treated within a historical context, and their influence on art criticism and aesthetics is shown. Here, critical visual theories that utilize the terms are applied to key visual images and objects. The diverse artworks cited include the bronze statue of "The Four Horses of San Marco," Manet's "A Bar at the Folies-Bergere," Walker Evans's photograph "Annie Mae Gudger," and Jeff Koons's "Vacuum Cleaner."

Like a door or pathway, activating a marma point opens into the inner pharmacy of the body. The body is a silent, universal, biochemical laboratory operating every moment to interpret and transform arising events. Touching a marma point changes the body's biochemistry and can unfold radical, alchemical change in one s makeup. Stimulation of these inner pharmacy pathways signals the body to produce exactly what it needs, including hormones and neurochemicals that heal the body, mind and consciousness. This deep dimension of marma therapy has the potential to unfold spiritual healing. </p><p> Marma points are an important element of Ayurveda's healing power. Developed in India centuries ago, these energy points profoundly affect the body, mind and spirit and facilitate the deepest levels of healing. Prana is the current of energy that infuses every cell within the body. Stimulating marmani (energy points) directly taps into this reservoir of energy and promotes health. </p><p> This work is the first of its kind to systematically present all 117 marmani according to their individual energetics and to compare them with the Chinese system of acupuncture points. Detailed commentaries for each marma shed light on their diagnostic and therapeutic scope. Marma therapy integrates vital knowledge of the energy points with specific techniques of Ayurvedic massage, detoxification, acupressure, aromatherapy, yoga practices, meditation and more. </p><p> This book is a valuable resource for Ayurvedic practitioners and acupuncturists as well as medical doctors, massage therapists and yoga therapists. It also serves as a foundation to develop tools for one's own self-healing and for students of various medical systems who are motivated to pursue a holistic approach to health.</p></p><p>Vasant Lad, Ayurvedic Physician, brings a wealth of classroom and practical experience to the United States.

The book became the most successful treatise on Buddhism in English, selling more than one million copies to date. <i>Branching Streams Flow in the Darkness</i> is the first follow-up volume to Suzuki Roshi's important work. Like <i>Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</i>, it is a collection of lectures that reveal the insight, humor, and intimacy with Zen that made Suzuki Roshi so influential as a teacher.<br><br>The <i>Sandokai</i>&#x2014;a poem by the eighth-century Zen master Sekito Kisen (Ch. Shitou Xiqian)&#x2014;is the subject of these lectures. Given in 1970 at Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, the lectures are an example of a Zen teacher in his prime elucidating a venerated, ancient, and difficult work to his Western students. The poem addresses the question of how the oneness of things and the multiplicity of things coexist (or, as Suzuki Roshi expresses it, "things-as-it-is"). Included with the lectures are his students' questions and his direct answers to them, along with a meditation instruction. Suzuki Roshi's teachings are valuable not only for those with a general interest in Buddhism but also for students of Zen practice wanting an example of how a modern master in the Japanese Soto Zen tradition understands this core text today.</p><p>"An opportunity to peer even more deeply into Suzuki Roshi's Zen mind and ponder the true meaning and value of recognizing the non-dual in our ordinary lives. The repartee with his students is by itself a great and unexpected gift, reviving that charming voice and warm wisdom we grew to know and love so well through <i>Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</i>"&#x2014;Jon Kabat-Zinn, author of <i>Wherever You Go, There You Are</i> and coauthor of <i>Everyday Blessings</i><br><br>"Suzuki Roshi's gentle wisdom shines through these intimate talks on the Sandokai. I am grateful to Mel Weitsman and Michael Wenger for their labor of love."&#x2014;Robert Aitken, author of <i>Taking the Path of Zen and Original Dwelling Place</i><br><br>"Buddhists and lovers of Buddhism who have read and reread Suzuki Roshi's <i>Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</i> over the years, as well as those who are just discovering the wisdom of this wonderful, profound teacher for the first time, will welcome this new book of lectures on Zen training as a gift we did not expect to receive. <i>Branching Streams</i> should be read slowly and savored."&#x2014;Rita M. Gross, author of <i>Buddhism After Patriarchy</i><br><br>"Through the poetry of knowing and doing, Shunryu Suzuki points out a path of practical wisdom for Americans today, in a voice so close at hand it can touch their inner experience of the interdependence of existence, open their ears to hear its harmony of difference and sameness, and awaken their willingness to be true to its mystery."&#x2014;Stephen Tipton, co-author of <i>Habits of the Heart</i><br><br>"A wonderful manifestation of Suzuki Roshi's fresh insights and teachings--small, pithy, wild nuts delicious to anyone who chooses to taste them."&#x2014;Peter Matthiessen "Muryo Roshi," author of <i>Sal Si Puedes (Escape If You Can)</i><b>Shunryu Suzuki Roshi</b> came to the United States in 1959, leaving his temple in Yaizu, Japan, to serve as priest for the Japanese American congregation at Sokoji Temple in San Francisco. In 1967 he and his students created the first Zen Buddhist monastery in America at Tassajara in the coastal mountains south of San Francisco. Suzuki Roshi died in 1971 at age 67, a year and a half after delivering his teaching on the <i>Sandokai</i>. He may have had a premonition of his coming death when he said that it was common for Zen teachers in the Soto tradition to lecture on the <i>Sandokai</i> near the end of life.<br><b>Mel Weitsman</b> is the former abbot of the San Francisco Zen Center and current abbot of the Berkeley Zen Center. <b>Michael Wenger</b> is Dean of Buddhist Studies at the San Francisco Zen Center.</p><h2>Dinotopia, First Flight: 20th Anniversary Edition (Calla Editions)</h2><p>This lavishly produced volume begins with an unabridged republication of Gurney's influential 1999 story about the adventures of Gideon Altaire.

He places new media within the histories of visual and media cultures of the last few centuries. He discusses new media's reliance on conventions of old media, such as the rectangular frame and mobile camera, and shows how new media works create the illusion of reality, address the viewer, and represent space. He also analyzes categories and forms unique to new media, such as interface and database.</p><p>Manovich uses concepts from film theory, art history, literary theory, and computer science and also develops new theoretical constructs, such as cultural interface, spatial montage, and cinegratography. The theory and history of cinema play a particularly important role in the book. Among other topics, Manovich discusses parallels between the histories of cinema and of new media, digital cinema, screen and montage in cinema and in new media, and historical ties between avant-garde film and new media.</p></p><p>Lev Manovich is Professor of Visual Arts, University of California, San Diego. His book <i>The Language of New Media</i> (MIT Press, 2001) has been hailed as "the most suggestive and broad ranging media history since Marshall McLuhan."<p><i>The Language of New Media</i>, Manovich surpasses previous prophets of the new media by uncovering the way that what is new is often rooted in a transformation and rediscovery of the slumbering utopian energies of the past. Manovich not only describes the recent history of new media, but its foundations, and its intellectual and aesthetic debts to such aspects of media history as russian constructivism and early cinema. Striking while the media is still hot, Manovich sees creative possibilites and transformation, yet never falls into the trap of thinking new media have no history or have single-handedly created a new world. His vision is unique, risky, and compelling.</p>&#x2015;<b>Tom Gunning</b>, Professor Art History and Cinema and Media, University of Chicago<br><br><p>This is simply the best book that I have read on the aesthetics of new media. Other authors have often made exaggerated and superficial claims about the novelty of art and design in the new digital technologies. Manovich offers us instead a sober and yet always fresh and exciting analysis of the relationships between new media and their predecessors, especially cinema. As a practicing artist as well as a theorist and historian of media, Manovich can explain the continuities with the past. This sense of history enables him to argue convincingly for the qualities of new media that he believes are truly new.</p>&#x2015;<b>Jay David Bolter</b>, Wesley Chair of New Media, Georgia Institute of Technology, author with Richard Grusin of <i>Remediation</i><br><br><p>Spend some of your precious time with this book, as time, in every sense, will prove that its succinct and careful analysis of new media is the most fundamental yet dynamic yet made. Lev Manovich's book is an intelligent object; its fractals capacitate a complex, yet accessible linguistic gateway to the history of new media forms, pushing these out of isolation towards tgeir relevant epistemologies in cinema, software development, programming languages, writing and communications theory, yet acknowledging unique qualities. It is a must for filmmakers, communications theorists, television producers, computer scientists, programmers, cultural critics, artists, cultural historians, and designers.</p>&#x2015;<b>Sara Diamond</b>, Artistic Director, Media and Visual Arts, The Banff Centre<br><br><p>Lev Manovich's <i>The Language of New Media</i> is a major event for those of us interested in understanding the nature of electronic literature and art. Deeply informed by an intimate knowledge of computer programming, architecture, and procedures, <i>The Language of New Media</i> combnies theoretical sophistication with rigorous inquiry into electronic processes of signification. Among its contributions are a much more precise vocabulary of New Media than is currently in use within cultural and literary studies; original and brilliant insights into the relation between narrative and database; and a comprehensive treatment of the means by which the cybernetic circuit between user and computer transfigures reading and writing. This is essential reading for anyone interested in literary and artistic uses of new media.</p>&#x2015;<b>N. Katherine Hayles</b>, Professor of English, and Design and New Media, University of California</p><h2>The Promise of Politics</h2><p>In <i>The Promise of Politics, </i>Hannah Arendt examines the conflict between philosophy and politics. In particular, she shows how the tradition of Western political thought, which extends from Plato and Aristotle to its culmination in Marx, failed to account for human action. The concluding section of the book, &#x201c;Introduction <i>into</i> Politics,&#x201d; examines an issue that is as timely today as it was when Arendt first wrote about it fifty years ago&#x2013;the modern prejudice against politics. When politics is considered as a means to an end that lies outside of itself, argues Arendt, when force is used to create &#x201c;freedom,&#x201d; the very existence of political principles is imperiled.</p><p>Hannah Arendt was born in Hanover, Germany, in 1906, fled to Paris in 1933, and came to the United States after the outbreak of World War II.

Arendt died in 1975."A brilliantly erudite and imaginative book."<br>--Adam Kirsch, <i>The New York Sun</i><br><br>&#x201c;By insisting that politics remain a promise rather than a threat, Arendt offers a hope that history has yet to justify.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>The New York Sun<br><br></i>&#x201c;Arendt demonstrated, brilliantly, how our habitual view of politics as an instrument in the service of private liberty, material gain, and social prosperity actually increases the dangers posed by the modern world.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Dana R.

This &#x201d;trial of the century&#x201d; not only cast Dayton into the national spotlight, it epitomized America's ongoing struggle between individual liberty and majoritarian democracy.Now, with this authoritative and engaging book, Edward J. Larson examines the many facets of the Scopes trial and shows how its enduring legacy has crossed religious, cultural, educational, and political lines.The &#x201d;Monkey Trial,&#x201d; as it was playfully nicknamed, was instigated by the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge a controversial Tennessee law banning the teaching of human evolution in public schools. The Tennessee statute represented the first major victory for an intense national campaign against Darwinism, launched in the 1920s by Protestant fundamentalists and led by the famed politician and orator William Jennings Bryan. At the behest of the ACLU, a teacher named John Scopes agreed to challenge the statute, and what resulted was a trial of mythic proportions. Bryan joined the prosecutors and acclaimed criminal attorney Clarence Darrow led the defense a dramatic legal matchup that spurred enormous media attention and later inspired the classic play <i>Inherit the Wind.</i> The Scopes trial marked a watershed in our national discussion of science and religion. In addition to symbolizing the clash between evolutionists and creationists, the trial helped shape the development of both popular religion and constitutional law in America, serving as a precedent for more recent legal and political battles. With new archival material from both the prosecution and the defense, paired with Larson's keen historical and legal analysis, <i>Summer for the Gods</i> is poised to become a new classic on a pivotal milestone in American history.</p><p>If you haven't seen the film version of <i>Inherit the Wind</i>, you might have read it in high school. And even people who have never heard of either the movie or the play probably know something about the events that inspired them: The 1925 Scopes "monkey trial," during which Darwin's theory of evolution was essentially put on trial before the nation. <i>Inherit the Wind</i> paints a romantic picture of John Scopes as a principled biology teacher driven to present scientific theory to his students, even in the teeth of a Tennessee state law prohibiting the teaching of anything other than creationism. The truth, it turns out, was something quite different. In his fascinating history of the Scopes trial, <i>Summer for the Gods</i>, Edward J. Larson makes it abundantly clear that Truth and the Purity of Science had very little to do with the Scopes case. Tennessee had passed a law prohibiting the teaching of evolution, and the American Civil Liberties Union responded by advertising statewide for a high-school teacher willing to defy the law. Communities all across Tennessee saw an opportunity to put themselves on the map by hosting such a controversial trial, but it was the town of Dayton that came up with a sacrificial victim: John Scopes, a man who knew little about evolution and wasn't even the class's regular teacher. Chosen by the city fathers, Scopes obligingly broke the law and was carted off to jail to await trial. <p> What happened next was a bizarre mix of theatrics and law, enacted by William Jennings Bryan for the prosecution and Clarence Darrow for the defense. Though Darrow lost the trial, he made his point--and his career--by calling Bryan, a noted Bible expert, as a witness for the defense. <i>Summer for the Gods</i> is a remarkable retelling of the trial and the events leading up to it, proof positive that truth is stranger than science.</p><b>Edward J.

For the second edition, Bloom offers an introduction which explains the genesis of his thinking and the subsequent influence of the book on literary criticism of the past twenty years.</p><p>Harold Bloom&#39;s The Anxiety of Influence has cast its long shadow of influence since it was first published in 1973. Through an insightful study of Romantic poets, Bloom puts forth his central vision of the relations between precursors and the individual artist. His argument that all literary texts are a strong misreading of those that precede them had an enormous impact on the practice of criticism and post-structuralist literary theory. The book remains a central work of criticism for all students of literature. Written in a moving personal style, anchored by concrete examples, and memorable quotations, this second edition of Bloom&#39;s classic work maintains that the anxiety of influence cannot be evaded - neither by poets nor by responsible readers and critics. A new introduction, centering upon Shakespeare and Marlowe explains the genesis of Bloom&#39;s thinking, and the subsequent influence of the book on literary criticism of the past quarter of a century.<br> <strong>Harold Bloom</strong> is Sterling Professor of the Humanities at Yale University and Berg Professor of English at New York University.

It offers a clear, logical learning sequence rather than merely a collection of assignments: inquiry is the search for truth, what we call an earned opinion, which then becomes the basis of efforts to convince others to accept our earned opinions. Case-making, the essence of convincing, is then carried over into learning how to persuade, which, requires explicit attention to appeals to character, emotion, and style. Finally, the previous three aims all play roles in negotiation, which amounts to finding and defending positions capable of appealing to all sides in a dispute or controversy.<br><br>Connect Composition supports instruction across multiple semesters and courses with interactive exercises, online learning videos, enriched ebook materials,annotation and writing tools, and much more!<br>�<b>LearnSmart Achieve</b> &#x2013; a continuously adaptive learning system that pinpoints students&#x2019; individual strengths and weaknesses and provides personalized support to help them master key topics and material.

Search no further." --Martin Amis, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i><p> Originally published in 1953, Saul Bellow's modern picaresque tale grandly illustrates twentieth-century man's restless pursuit of an elusive meaning. Augie March, a young man growing up in Chicago during the Great Depression, doesn't understand success on other people's terms. Fleeing to Mexico in search of something to fill his restless soul and soothe his hunger for adventure, Augie latches on to a wild succession of occupations until his journey brings him full circle. Yet beneath Augie's carefree nature lies a reflective person with a strong sense of responsibility to both himself and others, who in the end achieves a success of his own making. A modern-day Columbus, Augie March is a man searching not for land but for self and soul and, ultimately, for his place in the world.</p><p> "A book of extraordinary and massive power ... plainly one of the richest of twentieth-century American novels." --Alfred Kazin</p><p> "[Bellow's] body of work is more capacious of imagination and language than anyone else's....

Richard Dawkins offers a controversial reinterpretation of that idea in <em>The Extended Phenotype</em>, now being reissued to coincide with the publication of the second edition of his highly-acclaimed <em>The Selfish Gene</em>. He proposes that we look at evolution as a battle between genes instead of between whole organisms. We can then view Nanges in phenotypes--the end products of genes, like eye color or leaf shape, which are usually considered to increase the fitness of an individual--as serving the evolutionary interests of genes.<br> Dawkins makes a convincing case that considering one's body, personality, and environment as a field of combat in a kind of "arms race" between genes fighting to express themselves on a strand of DNA can clarify and extend the idea of survival of the fittest. This influential and controversial book illuminates the complex world of genetics in an engaging, lively manner.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Richard Dawkins</strong> is a Fellow of New College and Lecturer in Animal Behavior at Oxford University.

Marger received his bachelor&#39;s degree from the University of Miami, his master&#39;s degree from Florida State University, and his doctorate from Michigan State University. In addition to his research and writing in the field of race and ethnic relations, his work includes studies in social inequality and political sociology. He is also the author of SOCIAL INEQUALITY: PATTERNS AND PROCESSES."(The writing style) is the best part of the project. The style of writing is more narrative in form and vastly easier to understand for students. Concepts and ideas are developed in such a way that students can retain them longer than more conventional styles." "I am impressed with two things. First, the emphasis on "white ethnics" especially Italian-Americans because they fit better the conflict paradigm in terms of their experiences with prejudice and discrimination. Second, the global coverage. I know of no other text that does this in such a complete way."<br><br>"I received a copy of Marger's text and after a review of the book, I immediately knew it was the text I had been looking for. First, I found one of the major strengths of the book to be its organization, its very distinctive approach. Marger makes it very clear that his focus is to present the major concepts and theories grounding the study of race and ethnic relations and then apply these to various racial and ethnic groups. Part 1 "The Nature of Ethnic Relations" introduces the students to the basic concepts and theories, and as we know, for many students, dealing with the abstract can be quite challenging. Marger, however, brings the abstract alive when in Part II, he applies these concepts and theories to specific racial and ethnic groups. This particular framework has provided me with a most productive pedagogical design in the classroom." "Marger's writing is very clear and precise with no room for anything extraneous. He succinctly gets to the point - no verbiage. Clearly, this text was written with teaching and students in mind."<br><br>"There is a global perspective present in this book. It presents information that students need to understand for their careers."</p><h2>A History of Modern Europe: From the Renaissance to the Present</h2><p>This history of Europe since the Renaissance emphasizes not only cultural and social history, but also examines important political and diplomatic events.

Designed to resemble popular networking Web sites, the pages of this book feature "homepages" for each of the chemical elements -- complete with witty and informative profiles written by the elements themselves, plus a personally chosen picture.</p></p><p><p>High school chemistry teacher Adrian Dingle is the creator of the award-winning chemistry Web site: adriandingleschemistrypages.com.

Inspired by a love of simple line work and a rich color palette, his characters fill the gap between edgy manga and the cuteness of Hello Kitty. He lives in England.</p>The scope and qualities of this unique book are summed up better in its subtitle&nbsp;than&nbsp;in its title. While Dingle does little to explain the periodic table, he shows all the elements of the periodic table on a chart with very original graphics and spotlights 64 of the elements for closer examination on single pages or double-page spreads.&nbsp;Placed against a&nbsp;list including an element's symbol, atomic number, atomic weight, color, standard state, and classification, the element introduces itself in one, two, or three cheeky but informative paragraphs that focus on its qualities and uses. Each presentation ends with the element's date of discovery or earliest known use, its density, its melting point,&nbsp;its boiling point, and a digitally assisted color illustration with a distinctively Japanese, cartoonlike quality. The endpapers feature a glossary and an illustrated foldout poster of the periodic table. The quirky, idiosyncratic artwork and the unusual voice make this little book an appealing choice for introducing elements of the periodic table.

The fourth volume in this superb edition of <i>In Search of Lost Time&#x2014;</i>the first completely new translation of Proust's masterpiece since the 1920s&#x2014;brings us a more comic and lucid prose than English readers have previously been able to enjoy.<b><br><br></b><i>Sodom and Gomorrah</i>&nbsp;takes up the theme of homosexual love, male and female, and dwells on how destructive sexual jealousy can be for those who suffer it. Proust&#x2019;s novel is also an unforgiving analysis of both the decadent high society of Paris and the rise of a philistine bourgeoisie that is on the way to supplanting it. Characters who had lesser roles in earlier volumes now reappear in a different light and take center stage, notably Albertine, with whom the narrator believes he is in love, and the insanely haughty Baron de Charlus.</p><p><b>Marcel Proust </b>(1871�&#x2013;1922) was born in Auteuil, France. In his twenties, following a year in the army, he became a conspicuous society figure, frequenting the most fashionable Paris salons of the day. After 1899, however, his chronic asthma, the death of his parents, and his growing disillusionment with humanity caused him to lead an increasingly retired life. From 1907 on, he rarely emerged from a cork-lined room in his apartment on boulevard Haussmann. There he insulated himself against the distractions of city life and the effects of trees and flowers&#x2014;though he loved them, they brought on his attacks of asthma.

Seemingly irreconcilable forces are at work: fate and free will, the changeableness and stubbornness of ambitious men, the demands of public service and the desire for private gain. Drawn from history as recorded by Plutarch, the major characters-Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, and Mark Antony-are complex, as are the twists and turns of their fortunes. What kind of man rises to power? What price does he pay when he becomes a politician? These questions raised by Shakespeare are relevant in every age, whether ancient Rome, Elizabethan England, or even in our own day.</p><p><p><strong>Joseph Pearce</strong>, director of the Aquinas Center for Faith and Culture at Aquinas College in Nashville, is the author of three books on Shakespeare, all published by Ignatius Press, and is the editor of the Ignatius Critical Editions of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, The Merchant of Venice, <em>Julius Caesar</em>, <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>King Lear</em>, and <em>Macbeth</em>.

Not much is known about his date of birth or his formal education. Born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, he moved to London at age 21, where he wrote and acted in plays like Hamlet and As You Like It for the theatre group 'The King's Men'. Shakespeare, who died on 23 April 1616, gave the English language its most beautiful figures of speech, allegories, and images.</p><h2>The War of the Worlds (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels)</h2><p>One of the most famous science-fiction stories ever written, <i>The War of the Worlds</i> helped launch the entire genre by exploiting the concept of interplanetary travel. <br>First published in 1898, the novel terrified readers of the Victorian era with its account of an invasion of hostile creatures from Mars who moved across the English landscape in bizarre metal transports, using deadly heat rays to destroy buildings and annihilate all life in their path. Its power to stir the imagination was made abundantly clear when Orson Welles adapted the story for a radio drama on Halloween night in 1938 and created a national panic. <br>Despite readers' increasing sophistication about space travel and interplanetary invaders, <i>The War of the Worlds</i> remains a riveting reading experience. Its narrative energy, intensity, and striking originality remain undiminished, ready to thrill a new generation of readers with old-fashioned storytelling power.</p><p>This is the granddaddy of all alien invasion stories, first published by H.G. Wells in 1898. The novel begins ominously, as the lone voice of a narrator tells readers that "No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's..." <p> Things then progress from a series of seemingly mundane reports about odd atmospheric disturbances taking place on Mars to the arrival of Martians just outside of London. At first the Martians seem laughable, hardly able to move in Earth's comparatively heavy gravity even enough to raise themselves out of the pit created when their spaceship landed. But soon the Martians reveal their true nature as death machines 100-feet tall rise up from the pit and begin laying waste to the surrounding land. Wells quickly moves the story from the countryside to the evacuation of London itself and the loss of all hope as England's military suffers defeat after defeat. With horror his narrator describes how the Martians suck the blood from living humans for sustenance, and how it's clear that man is not being conquered so much a corralled. <i>--Craig E.

Wyeth capture the vitality of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x2019;s timeless tale of fortune, camaraderie, betrayal, and independence in this stunning picture book edition of <i>Kidnapped</i>.</b><br><br>David Balfour has never had an adventure. He has never spent a night camping in the Scottish Highlands. He has never sailed the high seas. He has never fought in a battle. In fact, David Balfour has never even left home. All he knows is a quiet country life. <br> <br>All of this changes after the death of his parents. He suddenly learns that he, David Balfour, is a man of wealth and standing, and that he is not destined for a simple life after all. All he needs to do to assume this new station in life is to travel to the town of Cramond, Scotland, to collect his inheritance from his father&#x2019;s younger brother, an uncle he had not even known existed. But David soon discovers that this is not as simple as it sounds, as he struggles to survive and outwit his treacherous uncle in this classic adventure story.</p><p>Robert Louis Stevenson was born on November 13, 1850. He spent his childhood in Edinburgh, Scotland, but traveled widely in the United States and throughout the South Seas. The author of many novels, including <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Kidnapped, The Black Arrow,</i> and <i>Treasure Island,</i> he died in 1894.<br><br>N.C. Wyeth&nbsp;(1882&#x2013;1945) began his artistic career as a young adult. Born in Needham, Massachusetts, Wyeth traveled the American West extensively and drew what he saw. His prolific career includes three thousand works and more than one hundred book illustrations, including those for a majority of the Scribner Illustrated Classics series.Grade 3-7 - The language in this adaptation is truer to the original, and thus, more sophisticated than that of Deborah Kestel's "Great Illustrated Classics" version (Playmore, 1992). After his father's death, David Balfour leaves his simple life in the Scottish Lowlands and sets out to find an uncle whom he has never met. Unaware of the bad blood between his father and uncle, he arrives at Ebeneezer's home, only to find that the cruel man has no intention of granting the lad his rightful inheritance. In fact, he has the boy kidnapped aboard a ship to be sold as a slave in North Carolina. David's tenacious spirit and his friendship with the rebellious Jacobite Alan Breck eventually bring him to safety. Told in 11 brief chapters, this abridgement introduces the basics of the story while maintaining a feel for the Scottish dialect. Some of the old-fashioned words and phrases may be a bit of a stretch for readers, but can be understood in context. Though obviously lacking in some of the details of the original, the narrative is easy to follow. Readers are able to gain insight into the hearts of David and Alan, although Ebeneezer and Captain Hoseason remain rather flat. Wyeth's oils (which appeared in the full-length version) add a sense of realism and capture interesting historical details. Meis's retelling retains the flavor of Stevenson's rollicking tale and might inspire readers to search out the full-length epic.<i> - Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Within a matter of hours, the Union ship&#x2019;s stern was blown open in a spray of wood planks. The explosion sank the ship, killing many of its crew. And the submarine, the first ever to be successful in combat, disappeared without a trace.<br> &nbsp;<br> For 131 years the eight-man crew of the <i>HL Hunley</i> lay in their watery graves, undiscovered. When finally raised, the narrow metal vessel revealed a puzzling sight. There was no indication the blast had breached the hull, and all eight men were still seated at their stations&#x2014;frozen in time after more than a century. Why did it sink? Why did the men die? Archaeologists and conservationists have been studying the boat and the remains for years, and now one woman has the answers.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>In the Waves</i> is much more than just a military perspective or a technical account. It&#x2019;s also the story of Rachel Lance&#x2019;s single-minded obsession spanning three years, the story of the extreme highs and lows in her quest to find all the puzzle pieces of the <i>Hunley</i>. Balancing a gripping historical tale and original research with a personal story of professional and private obstacles, <i>In the Waves</i> is an enthralling look at a unique part of the Civil War and the lengths one scientist will go to uncover its secrets.</p><p><b>Rachel Lance</b> is a biomedical engineer and blast-injury specialist who works as a scientific researcher on military diving projects at Duke University.

Pedagogy of Hope represents a chronicle and synthesis of the ongoing social struggles of Latin America and the Third World since the landmark publication of Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Here, Freire once again explores his best-known analytical themes--with even deeper understanding and a greater wisdom. Certainly, all of these themes have to be analyzed as elements of a body of critical, liberationist pedagogy. In this book, we come to understand the author&#39;s pedagogical thinking even better, through the critical seriousness, humanistic objectivity, and engaged subjectivity which, in all of Freire&#39;s books, are always wedded to a unique creative innovativeness. Pedagogy of Hope is a testimonial to the inner vitality of generations that have not prospered, and to the often silent, generous strength of millions who refuse to let hope be extinguished: people throughout the world who have been empowered by Pedagogy of the Oppressed and all of Paulo Freire&#39;s writings.</p><p>Paulo Freire explores the development and impact of the ideas developed in his masterpiece, <i>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</i>.Paulo Freire is the author of the bestselling Pedagogy of the Oppressed as well as Education for Critical Consciousness, Pedagogy in Process (The Letters to Guinea-Bissau), Learning to Question (with Antonio Faundez), and Pedagogy of the City.</p><h2>The North American Indian $$$</h2><p>In this dossier, Curtis provides a pictorial record of more than 80 American Indian tribes, their traditions and customs.

Esposito, Editor-in-Chief of the four-volume <em>Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World</em>, has gathered together sixteen leading scholars, both Muslim and non-Muslim, to examine the origins and historical development of Islam--its faith, community, institutions, sciences, and arts. Beginning in the pre-Islamic Arab world, the chapters range from the story of Muhammad and his Companions, to the development of Islamic religion and culture and the empires that grew from it, to the influence that Islam has on today's world. The book covers a wide array of subjects, casting light on topics such as the historical encounter of Islam and Christianity, the role of Islam in the Mughal and Ottoman empires, the growth of Islam in Southeast Asia, China, and Africa, the political, economic, and religious challenges of European imperialism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and Islamic communities in the modern Western world. In addition, the book offers excellent articles on Islamic religion, art and architecture, and sciences as well as bibliographies. <br> Events in the contemporary world have led to an explosion of interest and scholarly work on Islam. Written for the general reader but also appealing to specialists, <em>The Oxford History of Islam</em> offers the best of that recent scholarship, presented in a readable style and complemented by a rich variety of illustrations.</p><p>The entire history of Islamic civilization is, of course, too much to cover in a single volume, but John Esposito comes close. In a book topping 700 pages and containing over 300 photographs, Esposito brings together experts in fields such as early Islamic history, art and architecture, science and medicine, Islam in Africa and Southeast Asia, and contemporary Islam. Beginners will be swimming in new discoveries, while old hands will find connections and facts they never suspected. Majid Fakhry, for instance, shows not only the influence of philosopher Ibn Rushd (Averroes) on European intellectuals but also unveils the claims and counterclaims within Islamic philosophy over time. Dru Gladney takes us on an eye-opening journey through Islamic Central Asia and even China, where the Muslim Hui people are recognized as the country's third-largest minority nationality. And have you ever seen an exquisite mosque with towering spires made entirely of mud-brick, like there are in West Africa? Unfortunately, Esposito apparently couldn't find room here for separate sections on Sufism or Islamic literature, but there are more than enough mosques, paintings, historical maps, and tapestries throughout to keep you turning pages and learning with fascination. <i>--Brian Bruya</i><br><strong>John L.

Nothing less than the fate of life on Earth lies in the balance, which makes for an engrossing plot, made more poignant by the scientific research and data that back it up. Black-and-white cartoons clearly explain, define, and graphically display terms, events, and situations. They also impart both an awareness of the destructive behavior of humankind and its consequences while imparting a sense of hope for the future. The foreword, the brief notations dispersed throughout the drawings, and the bibliography provide information about sources used in formulating the book. Gonick's humor helps to lighten the dark realization of what is happening to the Earth. Teens will be drawn to the format, the short chapters, and the drama of the our planet's fate, a potentially frightening scenario that should motivate more research about the environment.?Pam Johnson, Fairfax County Public Library, VA<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Studio Thinking: The Real Benefits of Visual Arts Education</h2><p>''Studio Thinking [is] a vision not only of learning in the arts but what could be learning most anywhere.'' -- From the Foreword by David N.

He lives in New York City.</p><h2>Lies Across America: What Our Historic Sites Get Wrong</h2><p>The fabulous sequel to the bestselling, award-winning &#34;Lies My Teacher Told Me.&#34; James Loewen&#39;s last book, Lies My Teacher Told Me, a debunking of the twelve leading high-school American history textbooks, won the American Book Award, the AESA Critics&#39; Choice Award, and the Oliver Cromwell Cox Award for Anti-Racist Scholarship. It has sold more than a quarter-million copies in its various editions. Now, using the same irrepressibly honest approach and the same subversive take on all things bogus and misinformative, Loewen has identified a whole new arena for his one-of-a-kind inquiries into the way we tell our country&#39;s story. Lies Across America looks at more than one hundred sites where history is told on the landscape, including historical markers, monuments, outdoor museums, historic houses, forts, and ships. Loewen uses his investigation of these public versions of history, often literally written in stone, to correct historical interpretations that are profoundly wrong, to tell neglected but important stories about the American past, and, most importantly, to raise questions about what we as a nation choose to commemorate and how. Lies Across America offers startling revelations about sites we think we know: Valley Forge, Abraham Lincoln&#39;s log cabin, the Intrepid. It also tells of new sites, events, and individuals that should be commemorated on the landscape but aren&#39;t: a tombstone with a story to tell in Mississippi, a spy in the Confederate White House, the unforeseen fallout from the first nuclear missile test, the reverse underground railway, a modern &#34;sundown&#34; town (blacks can work there, but they&#39;d better leave before the sun sets). It asks why, across our landscape, Indians are consistently &#34;savage,&#34; tribal names are wrong and derogatory, whites &#34;discover&#34; everything, and the term &#34;massacre&#34; is a one-way street; why war museums have selective memories, guides at FDR&#39;s family mansion in Hyde Park are &#34;specifically forbidden&#34; to talk about Roosevelt&#39;s mistress, and James Buchanan&#39;s house makes no mention of the fact that he was gay. It muses about the Civil War mare in Kentucky who got an extra body part, the Polynesian King made to look like a Roman emperor on monuments in Hawaii, and the statue of a conquistador in New Mexico who lost his foot. This book is a reality check for anyone who has ever sought to learn about America through our public sites and markers. It is destined to change the way we see our country. Lies Across America includes: - Sites from all fifty states plus the District of Columbia, organized geographically, west to east - Introductory essays on: the role that monuments, markers, and other historic sites play in our society; how historic markers get on the landscape in the first place; what historic markers say about the era they commemorate versus the era in which they were erected; the visual symbolism of monuments and memorials; the way historical markers are revised over time (including natural forces, spray paint, and dynamite) - A list of twenty candidates for &#34;toppling&#34;--markers so distorting or inaccurate they should be removed or rewritten immediately -Forty black-and-white photos of notably interesting and/or awful markers</p><p>Little seems to delight historian James W. Loewen, author of <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i>, more than picking apart the cherished myths of American history. Few Americans study history after high school--instead, Loewen writes, they turn to novels and Oliver Stone movies to learn about the past. And they turn to the landscape, to roadside historical markers, guidebooks, museums, and tours of battlefields, childhood homes, and massacre sites. If you were to trust those sources, Loewen suggests, you would learn, erroneously, that the first airplane flight took place not at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, but at Pittsburg, Texas. "It must be true--an impressive-looking Texas state historical marker says so!" Loewen chortles. <p> In these entertaining pages, Loewen takes a region-by-region tour of the United States, pointing out historical oddments as he travels. For example, a massacre of white pioneers by Indians commemorated in Almo, Idaho, never took place, Loewen continues; neither did many other such events. Indeed, he insists, "throughout the entire West between 1842 and 1859, of more than 400,000 pioneers crossing the plains, fewer than 400, or less than .1 percent, were killed by American Indians." And if you were to visit Helen Keller's Georgia birthplace, over which a Confederate flag flies, you would get the impression that Keller had been an unreconstructed daughter of the Old South, whereas she was in fact an early supporter of the NAACP. And so on.</p><p> After finishing Loewen's alternately angry and bemused expos�, readers will likely never trust a roadside historical marker or tour guide again--which may prompt them to turn to history books to check things out for themselves. As well they should. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>James W.

He spent decades writing about just four of the most important periods, or "nodes.&#x201d; This is the first time that the monumental March 1917&#x2015;the third node&#x2015;has been translated into English. It tells the story of the Russian Revolution itself, during which the Imperial government melts in the face of the mob, and the giants of the opposition also prove incapable of controlling the course of events.</p><p>The action of Book 2 (of four) of <i>March 1917</i> is set during March 13&#x2013;15, 1917, the Russian Revolution's turbulent second week. The revolution has already won inside the capital, Petrograd. News of the revolution flashes across all Russia through the telegraph system of the Ministry of Roads and Railways. But this is wartime, and the real power is with the army. At Emperor Nikolai II&#x2019;s order, the Supreme Command sends troops to suppress the revolution in Petrograd. Meanwhile, victory speeches ring out at Petrograd's Tauride Palace. Inside, two parallel power structures emerge: the Provisional Government and the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers&#x2019; Deputies, which sends out its famous "Order No. 1," presaging the destruction of the army. The troops sent to suppress the Petrograd revolution are halted by the army&#x2019;s own top commanders. The Emperor is detained and abdicates, and his ministers are jailed and sent to the Peter and Paul Fortress. This sweeping, historical novel is a must-read for Solzhenitsyn's many fans, as well as those interested in twentieth-century history, Russian history and literature, and military history.</p></p><p>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (1918&#x2013;2008) is widely acknowledged as one of the most important figures&#x2015;and perhaps the most important writer&#x2015;of the last century. A Soviet political prisoner from 1945 to 1953, he set himself firmly against the anti-human Soviet system, and all anti-human ideologies, from that time forward. His story <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</i> (1962) made him famous, and <i>The Gulag Archipelago</i>, published to worldwide acclaim in 1973, further unmasked communism and played a critical role in its eventual defeat. Solzhenitsyn won the Nobel Prize in 1970 and was exiled to the West in 1974. He ultimately published dozens of plays, poems, novels, and works of history, nonfiction, and memoir, including <i>Cancer Ward, In the First Circle, The Oak and the Calf,</i> and <i>Between Two Millstones, Book 1: Sketches of Exile, 1974&#x2013;1978</i> (University of Notre Dame Press, 2018).<br><br>Marian Schwartz is a prizewinning translator of Russian literature. She is the principal translator of the works of Nina Berberova, Mikhail Bulgakov, Ivan Goncharov, and others."This third installment of <i>The Red Wheel</i>, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's narrative of the events leading to the Russian Revolution, is remarkable in its complexity. The novel presents a polyphonic kaleidoscope of people, places, and events, some real, some fictitious." (<i>Society Journal</i>)<br><br>"Marian Schwartz's new translation is the first time the expansive and resonant March 1917: Node III: Book 2 has been published in English. . . . Solzhenitsyn captures the chaos of the time, when a centuries-old order fell and the factions that would fight to replace it were still forming." (<i>Foreword Reviews</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Only a great work of art like <i>The Red Wheel</i> can convey the soul of a lawless mob that has lost all sense of measure. . . . This action-packed account, beautifully translated by Marian Schwartz, tells the story of one moment in which the failure of good men to act made all the difference in the world.&#x201d; (<i>The National Review</i>)<br><br>"In the first volume of <i>March 1917</i> . . . many haunting passages can be found, such as Nicholas II's confrontation with the icon of Christ following his tormented abdication." (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>"In <i>The Red Wheel</i>, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn produced a masterpiece, and proved himself a worthy companion of Dostoevsky and rival of Tolstoy." (<i>Law and Liberty</i>)<br><br>"Here we see how a millennium-old nation ruled by a monarchy that had lasted a good three centuries fell apart <i>in three days</i>. Book 2 of <i>March 1917</i> powerfully reveals how a decent if flawed political and social order collapsed 'with incredible alacrity,' as Solzhenitsyn writes elsewhere."

Born of Russian Jewish parents in Lachine, Quebec in 1915, he was raised in Chicago. He received his Bachelor's degree from Northwestern University in 1937, with honors in sociology and anthropology, and did graduate work at the University of Wisconsin. During the Second World War he served in the Merchant Marines.<br><br>His first two novels,&nbsp;<b>Dangling Man</b>&nbsp;(1944) and&nbsp;<b>The Victim</b>&nbsp;(1947) are penetrating, Kafka-like psychological studies. In 1948 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship and spent two years in Paris and traveling in Europe, where he began his picaresque novel&nbsp;<b>The Adventures of Augie March</b>, which went on to win the National Book Award for fiction in 1954. His later books of fiction include&nbsp;<b>Seize the Day</b>&nbsp;(1956);&nbsp;<b>Henderson the Rain King</b>&nbsp;(1959);&nbsp;<b>Mosby's Memoirs and Other Stories</b>&nbsp;(1968);&nbsp;<b>Mr. Sammler's Planet</b>&nbsp;(1970);&nbsp;<b>Humboldt's Gift</b>&nbsp;(1975), which won the Pulitzer Prize;&nbsp;<b>The Dean's December</b>&nbsp;(1982);&nbsp;<b>More Die of Heartbreak</b>&nbsp;(1987);&nbsp;<b>Theft</b>&nbsp;(1988);&nbsp;<b>The Bellarosa Connection</b>&nbsp;(1989);<b>The Actual</b>&nbsp;(1996);&nbsp;<b>Ravelstein</b>&nbsp;(2000); and, most recently,&nbsp;<b>Collected Stories</b>(2001). Bellow has also produced a prolific amount of non-fiction, collected in&nbsp;<b>To Jerusalem and Back</b>, a personal and literary record of his sojourn in Israel during several months in 1975, and&nbsp;<b>It All Adds Up</b>, a collection of memoirs and essays.<br><br>Bellow's many awards include the International Literary Prize for&nbsp;<b>Herzog</b>, for which he became the first American to receive the prize; the Croix de Chevalier des Arts et Lettres, the highest literary distinction awarded by France to non-citizens; the B'nai B'rith Jewish Heritage Award for "excellence in Jewish Literature"; and America's Democratic Legacy Award of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, the first time this award has been made to a literary personage. In 1976 Bellow was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature "for the human understanding and subtle analysis of contemporary culture that are combined in his work."Bellow&#39;s best-seller is the story of the relationship between Charles Citrine, a best-selling author, and his friend Von Humboldt Fleisher, a failed poet. It is not one of Bellow&#39;s greatest efforts, but was well-received when published almost twenty years ago. This production is exceedingly well-narrated by Christopher Hurt, whose narrator&#39;s voice conveys the various moods of the main character, Charles Citrine, an aging Lothario, battling the aging process and his writer&#39;s block. Some production flaws mar the presentation but can&#39;t overshadow the fine quality of the narrator&#39;s interpretation. E.F.

Chapters 1-3 introduce basic concepts of circuit analysis more deliberately and in greater detail than traditional texts, while establishing a solid mathematical foundation for the analysis and solution of problems. In Chapters 6-10, Davis presents a method of time domain analysis that unifies the three major divisions of circuit analysis (DC, AC, and transient analysis) based on the use of differential operators. In addition, from Chapter 1 onward, Davis presents circuit theories in the context of three fundamental quantities - time, voltage, and current - while emphasizing a practical, &#34;applications-oriented&#34; study of active circuits. As a result, this book provides students with a demonstrable mastery of problem-solving skills and an integrated knowledge of circuit analysis topics that effectively supports their later studies in signals and systems, electronics, and control.</p><p>San Jose State University San Jose CaliforniaPART I: DC ANALYSIS 1.

Shakespeare's glorious works have even inspired animated films--like Disney's The Lion King. Introduce children to the Bard with this wonderful, fully annotated collection of sonnets and soliloquies, enhanced with beautiful, highly realistic color paintings that bring each excerpt to vivid life. Here are Shakespeare's most famous speeches: "To be or not to be" from Hamlet, with the melancholy Dane pictured in front of the castle, his face pensive and gazing into the distance; Portia's gentle plea for mercy in The Merchant of Venice; Macbeth's witches' cackling "Double, double, toil and trouble"; and Marc Antony's sarcastic address to "Friends, Romans, Countrymen," in Julius Caesar. A golden-robed Henry V, kneeling and bowed from the weight of the world, ponders how rulers must bear the burden of their subjects' needs. Mercutio, seen here in a bright red background as fiery and explosive as his personality, gently teases his lovesick friend Romeo. From the tender sonnets (Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?) to the humorous songs sung by his jesters in comedies such as Twelfth Night, every page contains pure verbal and visual magic.<br><br>"...the most delicate challenge in introducing poetry to children [is]...making all the necessary allowances for accessibility without completely throwing felicity and mystery to the winds. In this respect...it is particularly heartening to come upon...The Poetry for Young People Series [which] should be commended for recognizing that secure stepping stones hold infinitely more hope than forced marches."--<i>Washington Post Book World</i>.<br></p><p><p>David Scott Kastan is the Old Dominion Foundation Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University and one of America&#x2019;s best-known Shakespeare scholars.

His original oils are exhibited in museums, galleries, and in private collections worldwide.&nbsp;Glenn lives and works in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.Gr. 5-7. This large-format volume from the Poetry for Young People series presents three sonnets as well as 24 excerpts from the plays of William Shakespeare. The sonnets are accessible as well as beautiful, but the use of dramatic excerpts is problematic. Some speeches, such as "All the world's a stage," from <i>As You Like It</i> and "The quality of mercy is not strained," from <i>The Merchant of Venice,</i> work well in this short anthology. Others, such as the two excerpts from <i>Henry IV, Part One</i>, seem unlikely to appeal as poetry, particularly to young people who do not know the play. Glenn Harrington has illustrated selections with impressionistic paintings. Often focusing on a single character, the paintings are well composed and richly colored. Consider this attractive book as supplementary material for children's collections with a demand for Shakespeare. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It is a world of heartbreak, violence, and pain, where severely ill men are often lost in a tangle of courts, jails, and bureaucracy. It is also a place of challenges, redemption, and surprising joy, where tough, hardworking doctors and staff fight to care for and keep safe a population that many would like to forget.

"You could say that these forceful fellows are the ones that really matter." They are grouped by associations: "Old School" (mass, weight, density, etc.), "Hot Stuff" (energy, entropy, etc.), "Wave Gang" (sound, frequency, etc.), "Light Crew" (radio wave, microwave, etc.), "Atom Family" (proton, electron, etc.), "Nuclear Heavies" (radioactivity, alpha particle, etc.), and "Electric Cuties" (static electricity, electric current, etc.). Each of the groupings begins with an introduction and each concept is given its own spread that shows the cartoon figure and describes its "personality." The information is presented in a chatty and conversational tone. For example, Blackbody Radiation is described as "a ninjalike shadow who swallows and slays the Light Crew." Along with the narrative, which is written in the first person from the concept's point of view, other key facts are presented.

These fantastic stories have travelled across cultural borders and been passed on from generation to generation, ever-changing, renewed with each re-telling. Few forms of literature have greater power to enchant us and rekindle our imagination than a fairy tale. <br><br>But what is a fairy tale? Where do they come from and what do they mean? What do they try and communicate to us about morality, sexuality, and society? The range of fairy tales stretches across great distances and time; their history is entangled with folklore and myth and their inspiration draws on ideas about nature and the supernatural, imagination and fantasy, psychoanalysis, and feminism. <br><br>Marina Warner has loved fairy tales over a long writing life and in <em>Once Upon a Time</em>, she explores a multitude of tales through the ages, their different manifestations on the page, the stage, and the screen. From the phenomenal rise of Victorian and Edwardian literature to contemporary children's stories, Warner unfolds a glittering array of examples, from classics such as <em>Red Riding Hood, Cinderella,</em> and <em>The Sleeping Beauty</em>, the Grimm Brothers' <em>Hansel and Gretel</em>, and Hans Andersen's <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, to modern-day realizations including Walt Disney's <em>Snow White</em> and gothic interpretations such as <em>Pan's Labyrinth.</em> <br><br>In 10 succinct chapters, Marina Warner digs into a rich hoard of fairy tales in their brilliant and fantastical variations in order to define a genre and evaluate a literary form that keeps shifting through time and history. Her book makes a persuasive case for fairy tale as a crucial repository of human understanding and culture.</p><p><br><strong>Marina Warner</strong>'s award-winning studies of mythology and fairy tales include <em>Alone of All Her Sex: The Myth and the Cult of the Virgin Mary</em>, <em>Stranger Magic: Charmed States &amp; the Arabian Nights</em>, <em>From the Beast to the Blonde - on Fairy Tales and their Tellers</em>, <em>Monuments &amp; Maidens: The Allegory of the</em> <em>Female Form</em>, and <em>No Go the Bogeyman: Scaring, Lulling and Making Mock</em>. Her Clarendon Lectures <em>Fantastic Metamorphoses, Other Worlds</em> were published in 2001. In 2015, she was awarded the Holberg Prize and in 2013, she was awarded a Sheykh Zayed Prize and the Truman Capote Award. She was awarded a CBE for services to Literature in 2008. She is a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, an Honorary Fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and the British Academy.<br><br>"[Warner] presents a thoughtful, discursive and often personal survey of how 'fairy tale' has expressed itself over the centuries.... Both a beguiling appreciation of and a fascinating tour through faery, this offers riches aplenty for lovers of fantasy fiction, children's literature and the tales themselves." --<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"[A]nyone interested in reading about the history of tales they first encountered in childhood will be edified and entertained." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"[An] enchanting history of fairy tales.... A thought-provoking work for fans of history, sociology, literature, and film. Warner's writing is free of theoretical jargon and will appeal to readers of all types." --<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"[Warner] draws together her research, touching on anthropology, psychoanalysis, literary analysis and an expansive history. For such a small book it carries a heavy load, but Ms. Warner's insights are both surprising and rewarding." --<em>The Economist</em><p></p><br>"<em>Once Upon a Time</em> is a perfect 'short history of the fairy tale.' The writing is pungent, the authority unassailable, the pace quick.... Warner, in short, knows fairy tales better than Mother Goose herself." --Michael Dirda, <em>Washington Post</em><p></p><br>"In this lively, scholarly work, Warner surveys centuries of fairy tales and academic research about them. She ties these tales to virtually every aspect of culture--mythology, art, music, movies, games, and psychology. We need them, she says, to make sense of the world." --Charles Euchner, <em>Boston</em> <em>Globe</em><p></p><br>"[B]esides the wealth of information here, the strongest readerly pleasures are her associations with and riffs on the many, many things fairy tales touch.... <em>Once Upon a Time</em> is clearly an academic book, but it soars beyond its practical purpose and into the realm of pure delight, where it will find a grateful readership in the general public." --<em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"[A] beautifully written, thought-provoking short study...." --<em>Shepherd Express</em><p></p><br>"This book could be written only by one who has known the field intimately over a long period. It is rich, clear, elegant, condensed...it is a perfect introduction for undergraduates and those beginning study in the field. Each chapter has a bibliography of the chief sources and suggestions for further reading; there is a helpful index. But what <em>Once Upon a Time: A Short History of Fairy Tale</em> offers most is a masterly synopsis of the complex, surprising, and serious aesthetic and cultural work of the fairy tale over time and in this moment. <em>Once Upon a Time</em> invites new exploration of the marvelous terrain while offering--unlike Hansel's breadcrumbs--a sense of where we've come from." -- <em>Papers on Language and Literature</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Courageous Women: A Study on the Heroines of Biblical History</h2><p><p><i>Courageous Women: A Study on the Heroines of Biblical History</i> is another volume in Stacy Mitch's popular Courageous series of Bible studies for women.</p> <p>An example is worth a thousand words.

The novel was a bestseller upon its publication in 1818, and it is now revised to collate the texts of 1818 and 1813 in a new, definitive edition.</p><p><i>Frankenstein,</i> loved by many decades of readers and praised by such eminent literary critics as Harold Bloom, seems hardly to need a recommendation. If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books." Includes an illuminating afterword by Joyce Carol Oates.A collection of literature anthologies and reference books for Key Stage 3 onwards.</p><h2>Anna Karenina (Everyman&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p>A famous legend surrounding the creation of <i>Anna Karenina</i> tells us that Tolstoy began writing a cautionary tale about adultery and ended up falling in love with his magnificent heroine. It is rare to find a reader of the book who doesn&#x2019;t experience the same kind of emotional upheaval. <i>Anna Karenina</i> is filled with major and minor characters who exist in their own right and fully embody their mid-nineteenth-century Russian milieu, but it still belongs entirely to the woman whose name it bears, whose portrait is one of the truest ever made by a writer. Translated by Louise and Aylmer Maude.</p></p><p>Some people say <i>Anna Karenina</i> is the single greatest novel ever written, which makes about as much sense to me as trying to determine the world's greatest color. But there is no doubt that <i>Anna Karenina</i>, generally considered Tolstoy's best book, is definitely one ripping great read. Anna, miserable in her loveless marriage, does the barely thinkable and succumbs to her desires for the dashing Vronsky. I don't want to give away the ending, but I will say that 19th-century Russia doesn't take well to that sort of thing.Introduction by John Bayley</p><h2>The Art of Voice: Poetic Principles and Practice</h2><p><p><strong>An award-winning poet, teacher, and &#x201c;champion of poetry&#x201d; (<em>New York Times</em>) demystifies the elusive element of voice.</strong></p><p>In this accessible and distilled craft guide, acclaimed poet Tony Hoagland approaches poetry through the frame of poetic voice, that mysterious connective element that binds the speaker and reader together. A poem strong in the dimension of voice is an animate thing of shifting balances, tones, and temperatures, by turns confiding, vulgar, bossy, or cunning&#x2015;but above all, alive.</p><p>The twelve short chapters of <em>The Art of Voice</em> explore ways to create a distinctive poetic voice, including vernacular, authoritative statement, material imagination, speech register, tone-shifting, and using secondary voices as an enriching source of texture in the poem. A comprehensive appendix contains thirty stimulating models and exercises that will help poets cultivate their craft. Mining his personal experience as a poet and analyzing a wide range of examples from Catullus to Marie Howe, Hoagland provides a lively introduction to contemporary poetry and an invaluable guide for any practicing writer.</p></p><p><strong>Tony Hoagland</strong> (1953&#x2015;2018) was the award-winning author of seven poetry collections, including the National Book Critics Circle Finalist <em>What Narcissism Means to Me</em> and <em>Priest Turned Therapist Treats Fear of God</em>, and two essay collections. He taught at the University of Houston and conducted a community workshop in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he lived.&#x201c;Tony Hoagland offers us in his poetry one of the most distinctive voices of our time. Now, in this last work of criticism he completed, he gives us a book focused directly on how a poetic voice is created, how the poet establishes a vivid personality who seems to be standing behind every line, and how in the course of the poem the poet manages to close the distance between speaker and reader to create an intimate bond. Everyone who cares about poetry will profit from this practical and luminous book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Carl Dennis</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Tony Hoagland was one of our greatest masters of the nuances, complexities, and vagaries of poetic voice. His seductive, deeply moving poems are, as he liked to say, &#x2018;connective,&#x2019; beginning in conversation and aspiring to intimacy between a poem&#x2019;s speaker and its reader. In <em>The Art of Voice</em>, Hoagland meditates on the possibilities available to those who would also aspire to poetic voice...This is a brilliant book by one of this country&#x2019;s foremost poets.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Kevin Prufer</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Tony Hoagland&#x2019;s rich scholarly savvy is tethered to the passion of a poet who lived as a poetry teacher. His breezy explications double as intimate, straightforward musings. His insights about audience and tone double as insights about how we speak to one another. <em>The Art of Voice</em> offers poetry as a life force, a means of humanizing a complex world. We are lucky to be left with this work of scrutinizing care and instruction.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Terrance Hayes</strong><br><br>&#x201c;In one of the last critical endeavors of his life, Tony Hoagland lends his extensive Apollonian critical dexterity to answering questions about what makes the <em>who</em> of a poem audible and apt. Anybody who loves poetry&#x2015;and wants to ponder again that old-fashioned question about the character of our speakers in any genre&#x2015;has got to read this book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Adrian Blevins</strong></p><h2>Semiconductor Physics And Devices</h2><p>Neamen's <i>Semiconductor Physics and Devices, Third Edition</i>. deals with the electrical properties and characteristics of semiconductor materials and devices.

B. White, Zora Neale Hurston, William Carlos Williams, and many others. Reprint.</p><p>Few cities on earth exert New York&#39;s pull on the literary imagination. There may be nothing like Paris in springtime, or a foggy day in London Town, but for sheer page volume, neither of these can rival the city that never sleeps. In celebration of Greater New York&#39;s centenary, the Library of America has assembled almost 200 years&#39; worth of literary Gothamiana--no small task, given the scope from which they had to choose. The result is a hefty, pleasingly eclectic anthology that works as both historical document and literary revelation. Editor Phillip Lopate has wisely chosen to include both the familiar (Melville&#39;s &#34;Bartleby the Scrivener,&#34; Whitman&#39;s &#34;Crossing Brooklyn Ferry&#34;) and the unknown (the diaries of English actress Fanny Kemble). Edith Wharton, Oscar Hijuelos, Henry Miller, Willa Cather, Tom Wolfe, Hart Crane: these are only a few of the writers who offer up their takes on the city, in terms that vary from nostalgic to cynical, romantic to tart. &#34;I want this new novel to be delicate and cutting--nothing will cut New York but a diamond,&#34; observes Dawn Powell; &#34;I don&#39;t like the city better, the more I see it, but worse,&#34; writes a homesick Thoreau. F. Scott Fitzgerald mourns the giddy New York of 1919, his &#34;lost city,&#34; while E.B. White lauds the metropolis for its dual bequests, &#34;the gift of loneliness and the gift of privacy.&#34; Vibrant, opinionated, more than a little bit overwhelming, the anthology is a fitting tribute to a city whose most enduring characteristic is the speed at which it can change. In the words of E.B. White, &#34;A poem compresses much in a small space and adds music, thus heightening its meaning. The city is like poetry: it compresses all life, all races and breeds, into a small island and adds music and the accompaniment of internal engines.&#34;<b>Phillip Lopate</b>, a native New Yorker, has contributed an introduction to <i>Writing New York</i> as well as headnotes to each of the selections.

Comic book writer and filmmaker David F. Walker joins with the art team of Damon Smyth and Marissa Louise to bring the long, exciting, and influential life of Douglass to life in comic book form. Taking you from Douglass's life as a young slave through his forbidden education to his escape and growing prominence as a speaker, abolitionist, and influential cultural figure during the Civil War and beyond, <i>The Life of Frederick Douglass </i>presents a complete illustrated portrait of the man who stood up and spoke out for freedom and equality. Along the way, special features provide additional background on the history of slavery in the United States, the development of photography (which would play a key role in the spread of Douglass's image and influence), and the Civil War. Told from Douglass's point of view and based on his own writings, <i>The Life of Frederick Douglass</i> provides an up-close-and-personal look at a history-making American who was larger than life.</p><p>DAVID F. WALKER is an award-winning comic book writer, filmmaker, journalist, and educator. Walker is best known for his work in comics, including <i>Shaft: A Complicated Man</i> (Dynamite Entertainment), winner of the 2015 Glyph Award for Story of the Year, and its sequel, <i>Shaft: Imitation of Life</i>. His work for Marvel Comics includes <i>Luke Cage</i>, <i>Occupy Avengers</i>, <i>Power Man and Iron Fist</i>, <i>Nighthawk,</i> <i>Fury</i>, and <i>Deadpool.</i> He's also worked for DC Comics <i>(Cyborg),</i> Boom!

MARISSA LOUISE is an illustrator and colorist whose color work has appeared in comics and graphic novels from Dark Horse, Image Comics, and BOOM! Studios, among others.&#x201c;This incredible graphic novel shines a much-needed spotlight on one of America's greatest heroes.&nbsp;<i>The Life of Frederick Douglass</i>&nbsp;deserves serious attention and David F. Walker is the perfect person to author this complex and compelling story.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Brian Michael Bendis</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>Words for Pictures</i>, writer of&nbsp;<i>Superman</i>, and co-creator of&nbsp;<i>Jessica Jones&nbsp;</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;<i>The Life of Frederick Douglass</i>&nbsp;humanizes the national icon of the abolitionist movement and restores a reflective realness to the man whose life still teaches us the meaning of moral conviction, determination, and service. Douglass lived his life at the epicenter of a defining age in American history and through his voice and words we walk alongside him on his journey through the encounters, struggles, and triumphs that shaped this country. Douglass first emancipated his mind through literacy, then his physical self by escaping enslavement as a runaway, setting off a lifelong quest for freedom and opportunity for people of color. Walker&#x2019;s narrative reads like a fireside chat with the grandfather of the abolitionist movement and illuminates dark corners of American history with the soulful reflection and truth-telling. This masterful story of emancipation draws from Frederick Douglass&#x2019; epic life to capture our national history through his personal narrative. This graphic narrative should be in every classroom in America! Douglass&#x2019; life story illuminates how great men, women, and indeed nations are born of moral struggle, perseverance, and progress.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Deirdre Lynn Hollman</b>, educator and founder of The Black Comics Collective<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A beautifully accessible and compelling graphic work that delves into the scathing truths that helped build our country.

Some of them manage money, others trade for themselves; some trade for a living, others are on the semi-professional level. All are totally serious and honest in sharing their trades with those who would like to learn. You will meet American and international traders who trade stocks, futures, and options using a variety of methods. All are normally very private, but now, thanks to their relationships with Dr. Elder, you can see exactly how these traders decide to enter and exit trades. Each chapter illustrates an entry and an exit for two trades, with comments by Dr. Elder. With this book as your guide, you can get closer to mastering the key themes of trading&#x2014;psychology, tactics, risk control, record keeping, and the decision-making process.</p> <p>The companion Study Guide is filled with striking insights and practical advice allowing you to test your knowledge and reinforce the principles outlined in <b>Entries &amp; Exits.</b></p></p><p><p><b>ENTRIES &amp; EXITS</b> </p><p><i>Entries &amp; Exits</i> takes you behind closed doors, into the trading rooms of sixteen private traders. They live in different countries, trade different markets, and use different methods, but all share a dedication to trading. Your guide on this journey is Dr. Alexander Elder, a bestselling author, professional trader, and practicing psychiatrist. </p><p>Each visit begins with a description of each trader's background and methods. He or she walks you through a winning and a losing trade, showing his or her signals on the charts, and explaining the reasoning behind them. After studying the entry, you are invited to decide whether that trade is likely to make or lose money. After you turn the page and see the exit, you learn how that trade worked out. Dr. Elder then shows you his charts for every trade and explains his analysis and decisions. At the end of each interview, he discusses a key aspect of trading, relevant to the trades you have just studied. </p><p><i>Entries &amp; Exits</i> provides an up-close and personal look at how real traders select trades and make decisions. You'll benefit from their hard-earned insights into trading psychology, analytic techniques, money management, record-keeping, and other essential aspects of successful trading.

The <i>Study Guide</i> contains 101 questions and answers, including twenty-five case studies.

These traders live in different countries, follow different markets, and use different methods, but all share several traits&#x2014;most importantly, their dedication to trading. They are utterly serious about their work, while most of the amateurs who supply the bulk of their winnings are chasing the excitement of an adrenaline rush. </p><p>Why would a person who is trading for a living talk about his or her method instead of grinding out profits in silence? Winners know full well that success in trading does not depend on knowing "the secret." There is no secret&#x2014;only hard work, focus, attention to detail, being careful and long-term oriented with money, and having a bit of flair. </p><p>Trading is a vast field, and like a doctor, you must specialize. Many beginners spread themselves painfully thin by investing in and day-trading stocks, futures, and options. Each trader in this book concentrates on an area that appeals to him or her, be it buying breakouts, writing puts, or trolling for dull stocks ready to explode from consolidation zones. </p><p>People become successful when they focus on what they love to do. In reading this book, you will probably come across a trading vehicle you like or a concept that appeals to you. Once you find it, stay with it and mine that area for its rich deposits. </p><p>There are massive differences between traders at various stages of development. Beginners look for tips, while intermediate traders keep asking about indicator settings. Experienced traders love to watch others make decisions and explain them. Traders in this book will share a wealth of information with you; what you take home is entirely up to you. </p><p>Trading can give you money, which can buy many good things&#x2014;freedom from a boss, the ability to travel wherever and whenever you like, and much more. Still, when the chips are down, it is not money that determines the quality of your life. Your goal in trading should be to become the best professional you can be. </p><p>We owe a debt of gratitude to the sixteen traders who opened their trading rooms&#x2014;helping all of us become better traders and serving as examples of kindness, generosity, and drive. They show us that there is more to life than money, even in a trader's life. This book is designed to help you break out of isolation, learn from others, pick up ideas that suit your style, and return to your trading room a better, more confident trader.</p></p><h2>Death in Venice and Other Tales</h2><p><b>A "brilliant . . . perfectly nuanced translation" (<i>The Boston Globe</i>) of Thomas Mann's greatest short works<br><br>A Penguin Classic</b><br><br>Featuring his world-famous masterpiece, "Death in Venice," this collection of Nobel laureate Thomas Mann's stories and novellas reveals his artistic evolution. In a widely acclaimed translation that restores the controversial passages that were censored from the original English version, "Death in Venice" tells about a ruinous quest for love and beauty amid degenerating splendor. Gustav von Aschenbach, a successful but lonely author, travels to the Queen of the Adriatic in search of an elusive spiritual fulfillment that turns into his erotic doom. Spellbound by a beautiful Polish boy, he finds himself fettered to this hypnotic city of sun-drenched sensuality and eerie physical decay as it gradually succumbs to a secret epidemic.<br><br> Also included in this volume are eleven other stories by Mann: "Tonio Kroger," "Gladius Dei," "The Blood of the Walsungs," "The Will for Happiness," "Little Herr Friedmann," "Tobias Mindernickel," "Little Lizzy," "Tristan," "The Starvelings," "The Wunderkind," and "Harsh Hour." All of the stories collected here display Mann's inimitable use of irony, his subtle characterizations, and superb, complex plots.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Mann's handling of these concerns in this story of a middle-aged German writer, torn by his passion for a Polish youth met on holiday in Venice, resulted in a work of great psychological intensity and tragic power. It is presented here in an excellent new translation with extensive commentary on many facets of the story.</p><b>Thomas Mann</b> (1875-1955) was one of the finest and most prolific German novelists of our century. His most famous works include <i>Buddenbrooks, The Magic Mountain, Doctor Faustus</i>, and the Joseph tetralogy. <br><br><b>Joachim Neugroschel </b>(1938-2011)&nbsp;won three PEN translation awards and the French-American translation prize.

From Wayne's early days as a production designer and puppet maker for the iconic TV show "Pee-Wee's Playhouse" to his unmistakable and exquisitely rendered text paintings, this monograph is a comprehensive view of Wayne White's oeuvre.<br><br>Wayne is a unique wordsmith, brilliantly juxtaposing irreverent and humorous phrases over existing thrift store paintings that together create a completely original and fictional landscape. Influenced by both his upbringing in rural Tennessee and a very sophisticated knowledge of art history. Wayne White's sensibility is completely singular and distinctive.<br><br>Wayne White's warped and perspectival words integrate into seemingly benign pastoral landscapes, creating a completely surreal experience. Wayne's expert painting chops and detailed attention to lighting and reflection place the "new" text directly in its "original" setting. Text paintings such as "Donald Judd was a Son of a Bitch Wrecked His Train in a Whorehouse Ditch," "Poon," and "Maybe Now I'll Get The Respect I So Richly Deserve" are a welcome departure from the more-often-than-not self-aggrandizing art world.</p><p>Artist Wayne White grew up in Tennessee and his nostalgia for his youth and Southern heritage is addressed in the rustic landscapes that he fills with monumental sized text.<p>"Residing now in Los Angeles, the Chattanooga-born painter has amassed a wild body of work, from set and puppet designs for 'The Pee-Wee Herman Show' to production design for Peter Gabriel's 'Big Time' video, to the mesmerizing phrase-in-landscapes, and to more abstract works.

While Elinor is thoughtful, considerate, and calm, her younger sister is emotional and wildly romantic. Both are looking for a husband, but neither Elinor&#x2019;s reason nor Marianne&#x2019;s passion can lead them to perfect happiness&#x2014;as Marianne falls for an unscrupulous rascal and Elinor becomes attached to a man who&#x2019;s already engaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Startling secrets, unexpected twists, and heartless betrayals interrupt the marriage games that follow.

Byatt and Edna O&#x2019;Brien. Her forthcoming book is a biography of three eighteenth-century British actresses.<br></p><p>Though not the first novel she wrote, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was the first Jane Austen published. Though she initially called it <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>, Austen jettisoned both the title and the epistolary mode in which it was originally written, but kept the essential theme: the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. The story revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Whereas the former is a sensible, rational creature, her younger sister is wildly romantic--a characteristic that offers Austen plenty of scope for both satire and compassion. Commenting on Edward Ferrars, a potential suitor for Elinor's hand, Marianne admits that while she "loves him tenderly," she finds him disappointing as a possible lover for her sister: <blockquote> Oh! Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference! </blockquote> Soon however, Marianne meets a man who measures up to her ideal: Mr. Willoughby, a new neighbor. So swept away by passion is Marianne that her behavior begins to border on the scandalous. Then Willoughby abandons her; meanwhile, Elinor's growing affection for Edward suffers a check when he admits he is secretly engaged to a childhood sweetheart. How each of the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Jane Austen&#39;s first published novel introduced many of the themes which would dominate Austen&#39;s future work. Austen writes about everyday events of her own time with a subtlety and sensitivity unprecedented in the English novel.

The book simulates what it would have been like to read <i>The Times</i> each day for the last half century, if the full picture of the African American experience had made the cut.

Very few of us in this age are farmers or dependent upon crops and harvests. Regional traditional witchcraft teaches people to find their craft in their own backyards, in the uncultivated land or urban cityscape alike, and in their ancestors rather than in ancient foreign deities or in a neopagan-styled religious form of witchcraft. It's not about where you're from but where you are.</p><p>The material is adaptable to any region in which the practitioner lives. Although the lack of deity worship and holy days is a significant part of the authors' nonreligious approach, this book presents a complete system of practice utilizing ritual, chant, trance, the six paths of witchcraft as defined and explained by the text, and the practices associated with traditional witchcraft.</p></p><p><b>Christopher Orapello</b> is an artist, witch, and animist with a background in Western occultism, ceremonial magick, and Freemasonry and has been on his journey for over 20 years. He cohosts the podcast <i>Down at the Crossroads</i> with his partner, Tara Maguire, and is a signature artist with Sacred Source, a leading producer and distributor of ancient deity images in North America. After a growing desire for a more locally based form of witchcraft, he and Tara founded the Blacktree Coven in 2014 and set out to forge a modern approach to traditional witchcraft for a new era of praxis. <b>Tara-Love Maguire</b> has been a practicing witch for over 30 years. Her path has been crookedly influenced by Isobel Gowdie, Marie Laveau, and William S. Burroughs (among others). Growing up in and around the New Jersey Pine Barrens, she found witchcraft within the tales and shadows of that folkloric landscape. She cohosts the podcast <i>Down at the Crossroads</i> with Christopher Orapello and is one of the founders of the Blacktree Coven, which exists in the heart of southern New Jersey."As an Appalachian witch, bioregional witchcraft is the only witchcraft that touches me, the only sort that reaches backward and forward, roving the spiritual as well as the physical landscape. This knotty and fine book is old and new, too--beautifully written, deeply researched and growing from the furrows of a genuine practice. Much to learn here and much to do. Bury yourself in <i>Besom, Stang &amp; Sword</i>'s evocative spirit." --<b>H. Byron Ballard</b>, witch and author of <i>Earth Works: Ceremonies in Tower Time</i><br><br>"In <i>Besom, Stang &amp; Sword</i>, Christopher and Tara-Love have crafted an approachable yet artful guide to the practice of traditional witchcraft from a uniquely North American perspective.

The book reorients the Craft to return to the primordial forces, animism, baneful plants, folk magic, ecstasy, and hedgewitchery without gatekeeping, armchair pseudo-academia, pretension or pomposity; making it incomparable to other books in its niche. The unclouded and grounded manner in which Orapello and Maguire write displays that they not only fully understand what they're writing about but that they are well-seasoned, knowledgeable, and insightful regarding the cosmology and praxis contained within its pages which allows them to teach it with crystal clarity." --<b>Mat Auryn</b>, author of <i>Psychic Witch</i> and blogger at For Puck's Sake on Patheos Pagan<br><br>"<i>Besom, Stang &amp; Sword</i> details a beautifully wrought and immensely practical system of modern traditional witchcraft, born of personal insight, working experience and dedication rooted deeply in the spirit of place.

The craft as they present it is without pretension and strikingly elegant in its simplicity, and it stresses the practitioner's sovereignty and relationship with the spirits of the land. <i>Besom, Stang &amp; Sword</i> is easily the most eminently practical book on traditional witchcraft available today." --<b>Nicholas Pearson</b>, author of <i>The Seven Archetypal Stones</i> and <i>Stones of the Goddess</i><br><br>"When I first met Christopher Orapello and Tara-Love Maguire, I knew I was in the company of witches. Despite the commonplace setting, I could feel the stir of the wind between the worlds and smell the scent of deep earth and moonlight. Their book, <i>Besom, Stang, and Sword</i> fulfills the promise of that first encounter. They have performed the Great Work of witches and have made the old become new and live again. Chapter by chapter, they lay out the tools and the paths of their system of witchcraft. If you do the work described, you will claim your place in a broader reality filled with majesty and power. There are a thousand and one ways to be a witch. This may be your way, but if it is not, it will still be worth your careful attention. All the magicks of the world are intertwined, each a twisting path forming the weave of things." --<b>Ivo Dominguez, Jr.</b>, author of <i>Keys to Perception, Practical Astrology for Witches and Pagans</i>, and other books of magick<br><br>"What an absolute treat to the senses it has been to delve into <i>Besom, Stang &amp; Sword</i>! This text presents a cohesive system of practice, thorough in exploring the fundamentals of magic, yet unafraid to delve into the dimly lit corners of witchcraft. Christopher Orapello and Tara-Love Maguire offer their own meticulously curated system based on theory, history, folklore, and trusted praxis. They cover an astonishing array of topics in a refreshingly concise manner and offer clear instruction along with their own rituals and spell work. What they present to us is intelligent methodology, and a powerful and spirit-fueled practice that reminds you that your tradition is a living creature to be respected and nurtured. Though a primer for their own magical system, there is no feeling of witchcraft-light here. This book encourages a deepening of your magic, a connection to your own bioregion, and a passion for the work you do with the land and your own spirits. This is sure to become a foundational text among magical practitioners. Orapello and Maguire have offered a treasure to their community with this tome.

Why? Because this book takes what I feel is the most essential truth of any real witchcraft and places it front and center: All witchcraft is local." --<b>Jason Miller</b>, author of <i>The Elements of Spellcrafting: 21 Keys to Successful Sorcery</i><br><br>"With <i>Besom, Stang, &amp; Sword</i>, Chris and Tara open the doors to their own practices, laying out the materials of magic for all to see. The results drive home the central point that magic--specifically witchcraft--is available to anyone, but that it requires time, effort, patience, and thought along with a dose of fate and a sizeable amount of risk. They build a hexagram of approachable practices that asks anyone picking up this work to root their magic in the land surrounding them and their own personal history, rather than taking secondhand sorcery from others. Chris and Tara reveal their Blacktree tradition without pretense or artifice, but instead with clarity, insight, and acid wit, which testifies to their talents as both seasoned occultists and engaging writers.

She experiences a zeitgeist-esque Spiritual Epiphany somewhere between the pages of <i>How to Find the Love You Want Without Seeking It</i> (can self-help books really help self?), protective custody, and a lightly chilled Chardonnay.</p><p>Fans of Helen Fielding's <i>Bridget Jones's Diary</i> will recall that at the end of that sly and funny version of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, singleton heroine Bridget landed her Mr. Darcy at last--Mark Darcy, that is. <i>Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason</i> picks up four weeks later, and already the honeymoon is over. In addition to discovering that the man of her dreams votes conservative, left-leaning Bridget is also feeling just a mite uncomfortable with the realities of sharing bed and board with another person: <blockquote> V. complicated actually having man in house as cannot freely spend requisite amount of time in bathroom or turn into gas chamber as conscious of other person late for work, desperate for pee etc.; also disturbed by Mark folding up underpants at night, rendering it strangely embarrassing now simply to keep all own clothes in pile on floor. </blockquote> But all of these problems pale to insignificance with the arrival on the scene of Rebecca, a beautiful, man-hunting arch-nemesis with "thighs like a baby giraffe" and absolutely no girlfriend code of ethics when it comes to poaching another woman's man. Before long, Rebecca's manipulations, Bridget's own insecurities, and a string of misunderstandings (starting with a naked Filipino boy in Mark Darcy's bed and ending with a suggestive valentine from Bridget's dry cleaner) result in "<i>128 lbs.

Her mother has returned from a trip to Kenya with a young Masai in tow--to her father's consternation; her best friends Jude, Shazzer, and Tom are all trapped in dating hell themselves; her apartment is in shambles thanks to a dotty carpenter; an unreliable ex-boyfriend has just reentered her life; and now someone is sending Bridget death threats--could it be Mark Darcy? If <i>Bridget Jones's Diary</i> was a modern riff on <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, its sequel borrows several themes and devices (not to mention a section heading) from another Austen novel, <i>Persuasion</i>. And as in Austen's fiction, here the journey <i>is</i> the destination.

A princess was a princess. &#x201c;Mama? Tell us.&#x201d;</p><p>Mama smiled. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you ever get sick of it, darling?&#x201d;</p><p>Jane shook her head fervently.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I was just eighteen, and it was the grandest ball of the season. Everybody was there, dukes, earls, even a royal prince.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And what were you wearing, Mama?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know very well what I was wearing, you&#x2019;ve heard it a hundred times.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mama!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very well, I was wearing a beeeyoutiful ball gown, rose-colored silk that swished like water when I walked.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And a gauze overdress&#x2014;go on,&#x201d; Jane prompted.</p><p>&#x201c;A gauze overdress with hundreds of tiny crystals sewn on it that caught the light&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And glittered like a shower of diamonds,&#x201d; Jane finished for her.</p><p>&#x201c;See, you know it better than I do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go on. And on your head&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On my head I wore a most elegant little headdress of pink pearls and diamonds&#x2014;of course, they were paste, but&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you came down the staircase, and everybody turned to look at you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Jane didn&#x2019;t want to hear about paste, which wasn&#x2019;t as good as diamonds&#x2014;not that she&#x2019;d ever seen any kind of jewelry, except for Mama&#x2019;s gold wedding ring&#x2014;but everybody knew a princess wore diamonds.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, little tyrant, and everybody turned to look at me in my beeyoutiful glittery pink dress.&#x201d; Mama laughed, but the laughter turned into a coughing fit that ended with her lying back on the bed, handkerchief pressed to her mouth, exhausted.</p><p>Abby fetched Mama some water and a clean handkerchief, slipping it into Mama&#x2019;s hands so that Papa wouldn&#x2019;t notice the blood on the old one. Abby was always secretly washing blood out of Mama&#x2019;s handkerchiefs.</p><p>After a while, Jane asked, &#x201c;Mama, why aren&#x2019;t you a princess now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m still a princess, my darling.&#x201d; Mama opened her eyes, and looked over Jane&#x2019;s head at Papa, who was standing behind her, silent and grim. &#x201c;That night I met and fell in love with your papa. He&#x2019;s my prince, and always will be.&#x201d; And she smiled up at Papa.</p><p>And Jane could see for herself that Mama really had been a princess because the smile made her beautiful again, so beautiful, as if someone had lit a candle inside her.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll always be my princess,&#x201d; Papa said in a choked voice, smoothing Mama&#x2019;s hair back and kissing her on the forehead.</p><p>Jane loved Papa dearly, but she knew he wasn&#x2019;t a prince. A prince lived in a castle, not one poky little room in a smelly old building.</p><p>Mama was supposed to have married someone else&#x2014;a rich man who did live in a castle. Papa too was supposed to marry another lady, but then they met each other and fell in love. And because they fell in love, they had to run away and get married, because their parents wanted them to marry the other people. The rich other people.</p><p>That was why Jane and Abby had never met their grandparents, even though Abby was almost twelve and Jane was nearly six. Because they were still angry. Papa and Mama had been cast out, cut off without a penny. That&#x2019;s why they had no money. Papa did his best, but there was never enough&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>If Mama were a princess now, she wouldn&#x2019;t be a thin shadow of herself, faded, sad and sick. And Papa wouldn&#x2019;t be so tight and angry and sad. Jane and Abby would be princesses too, and they&#x2019;d all be living in a castle, not a cold, dark little room, where rats scrabbled behind the walls. And none of them would ever be cold, or hungry or frightened.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be a princess too, when I grow up,&#x201d; Jane declared. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll have a pink glittery dress and wear diamonds and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Janey darling, it&#x2019;s just make-believe,&#x201d; Abby began.</p><p>&#x201c;No, I will!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, sweetheart, no matter what you wear, you&#x2019;ll always be Papa&#x2019;s little princess,&#x201d; Papa said, picking Jane up and twirling her around and around. And everybody laughed.</p><p>But Jane had no doubt of it. Twirling high in Papa&#x2019;s arms, she looked down at the dingy little room spinning around her, Mama lying weak and thin in her bed, and Abby crouched beside her with a clean cloth. It wasn&#x2019;t always going to be like this. Everybody said Jane was the image of her mother, and that meant she could be a princess too. She just had to find a prince with a castle.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter One</p><p>But there certainly are not so many men of large fortune in the world as there are pretty women to deserve them.</p><p>&#x2014;JANE AUSTEN, <i>MANSFIELD PARK</i></p><p>Mayfair, London, March 1817</p><p>&#x201c;That was a lovely treat, thank you, Abby.&#x201d; Jane squeezed her sister&#x2019;s arm affectionately as they walked through Berkeley Square. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe I had to wait eighteen years to taste ice cream.&#x201d;</p><p>Abby laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve made up for it in the last few months&#x2014;is there any flavor at Gunter&#x2019;s you haven&#x2019;t tasted?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Jane admitted, &#x201c;but I still haven&#x2019;t decided which is my favorite.&#x201d;</p><p>Abby laughed again. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s not even summer yet.&#x201d; It was barely even spring. The plane trees that lined the square were only just beginning to bud and a few scattered clumps of snowdrops were in bloom.</p><p>Jane squeezed her older sister&#x2019;s arm again. &#x201c;Ice cream or not, it&#x2019;s lovely to have the catch-up, just the two of us. I love Damaris and Daisy&#x2014;you know I do, but sometimes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Abby nodded. &#x201c;Sometimes you just need to be with your big sister, I know. It&#x2019;s the same for me.&#x201d; She paused, then glanced at Jane. &#x201c;Are you nervous about your season? Your first ball, it&#x2019;s what, ten days away?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A fortnight,&#x201d; Jane corrected her. &#x201c;And no, I&#x2019;m not nervous. Not really.&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;Well, nervous in a good way. If you want to know the truth, I can&#x2019;t wait. All those years in the Pillbury Home wearing gray and brown serge and never dreaming&#x2014;well, <i>only</i> dreaming about going to balls and parties and routs, wearing pretty dresses, dancing until dawn and going to plays and concerts and picnics, as Mama did. But I never truly believed it would happen, that one day&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She hugged her sister, then gave a happy little twirl. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so exciting, Abby. I feel so very lucky.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We are lucky,&#x201d; Abby said, sobering a little. &#x201c;All of us. If it weren&#x2019;t for Lady Beatrice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know. But she insists we rescued her, which is true too, in a way. And truly Abby, she&#x2019;s enjoying this as much as any of us. She couldn&#x2019;t be more delighted if we were her real nieces.&#x201d;</p><p>Abby laughed. &#x201c;Good thing I married her nephew then, which makes it almost true.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;<i>Nonsense! Your marriage to Max has nothing to do with it.</i> <i>If I want nieces, I&#x2019;ll dashed well have &#x2019;em!</i>&#x2019;&#x201d; Jane declared in an excellent imitation of Lady Beatrice, and they both laughed.</p><p>Abby linked arms with Jane again and they resumed walking. &#x201c;Oh, Jane, I&#x2019;m so happy. Happier than I ever dreamed possible. You have no idea. Marriage is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She gave a blissful sigh and then blushed. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;ll find out soon enough. You&#x2019;ll meet a handsome young man&#x2014;maybe even next week at the ball&#x2014;and you&#x2019;ll fall madly in&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you think Damaris and Freddy will have arrived in town yet?&#x201d;</p><p>Abby gave her a sharp glance, but accepted the change of subject. &#x201c;Damaris&#x2019;s last letter said they expected to arrive in London today or tomorrow, so they might have, yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, good. I can&#x2019;t wait to see her. Her letters from Venice contained some beautiful sketches&#x2014;it seems like a magical place. I wonder if I&#x2019;ll ever get to see it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jane&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>But Jane didn&#x2019;t want to talk about falling in love, which was all Abby talked about these days. &#x201c;Watch out,&#x201d; she said, pulling Abby back as a curricle whizzed past them. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not in the country now, Abby&#x2014;we have traffic in London, remember.&#x201d; They crossed the street and mounted the front steps of Lady Beatrice&#x2019;s house, where Jane and Daisy still lived.</p><p>Max, on his marriage to Abby, had rented a town house around the corner. He&#x2019;d offered to house Daisy and Jane there as well, but Lady Beatrice had objected strongly. &#x201c;Stealing my gels? Losing Abby and Damaris to you and Freddy is bad enough. What&#x2019;s wrong with newlyweds today&#x2014;don&#x2019;t you <i>want</i> privacy?&#x201d; Delivered with a gimlet stare magnified by her favorite lorgnette.</p><p>Abby and Max hadn&#x2019;t argued. And Freddy, taking the hint, had also arranged the hire of a town house for the season, within easy walking distance of Berkeley Square.</p><p>The front door opened silently before Jane could even reach for the bell. Featherby, their butler, placed a white-gloved finger over his lips in mysterious fashion and stood back to let them in.</p><p>Daisy was sitting on the stairs, halfway up. &#x201c;Daisy?&#x201d; Jane began.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Sssh!</i>&#x201d; Daisy made extravagant shushing gestures. Jane and Abby exchanged glances. What on earth was going on?</p><p>Featherby, tapping his finger against his lips to reinforce the need for silence, pointed to the door to the drawing room, which was ajar. Voices wafted out. Lady Beatrice and a male visitor. Nothing unusual there. So why were Daisy and Featherby behaving so mysteriously?</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2014;&#x201d; Jane began.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Shhh!</i>&#x201d; Daisy made fierce, emphatic gestures, beckoning to Jane to come up and to be quiet.</p><p>Mystified, Jane obeyed. Featherby stepped in front of the sitting room door, blocking them from the sight of the unknown visitor while Jane and Abby slipped past and hurried silently up the stairs.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; Jane whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;Sit down and listen!&#x201d; Daisy tugged her down beside her on the stairs. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about you.&#x201d;</p><p>Jane sat. So did Abby. The three girls leaned against the rails, listening intently to the voices coming from the drawing room.</p><p>The man, whoever he was, was talking about himself. &#x201c;Of course, you know my family and my circumstances, Lady Beatrice, and naturally my eligibility is not in doubt&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p><i>Eligibility?</i> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s he talking about?&#x201d; Jane whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s making an offer for you,&#x201d; Daisy whispered back.</p><p>&#x201c;For <i>me</i>?&#x201d; Jane squeaked. She turned and stared at Daisy. &#x201c;Who is he?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lord Cambury.&#x201d;</p><p>Jane gave her a blank stare. &#x201c;<i>Who?</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lord Cambury. He came to the literary society a couple of times.&#x201d;</p><p>Jane shook her head, none the wiser.</p><p>&#x201c;Little fat bloke. Thirty-three or so. Natty dresser. Balding.&#x201d; Daisy mimed a comb being dragged across a scalp and Jane suddenly remembered. Lord Cambury.</p><p><i>Lord</i> <i>Cambury? </i>There must be some mistake. He couldn&#x2019;t possibly be offering for her. She&#x2019;d barely exchanged a dozen words with the man.<i> </i>She leaned closer to hear the conversation coming from the drawing room.</p><p>But Featherby, who had been hovering casually near the drawing room door, suddenly turned and gestured urgently. Lord Cambury&#x2019;s voice grew louder, saying, &#x201c;Tomorrow then, Lady Beatrice. I look forward to it.&#x201d;</p><p>He was leaving. The girls rose and hurried up the stairs out of sight.</p><p>At the landing, Jane turned and peered down cautiously between the rails. She caught a glimpse of a pink and shiny pate, over which thin strands of fair hair had been carefully combed, and then Featherby was handing Lord Cambury his hat, coat and cane.</p><p>The front door closed behind him and Jane let out the breath she hadn&#x2019;t even realized she&#x2019;d been holding.</p><p>Featherby glanced up and said in a voice that carried up the stairs, &#x201c;Yes, m&#x2019;lady, Miss Jane and Lady Davenham are here with Miss Daisy. I&#x2019;ll call them down, shall I?&#x201d; The girls hurried downstairs.</p><p>&#x201c;Tea, m&#x2019;lady?&#x201d; Featherby asked as they entered the drawing room.</p><p>Lady Beatrice nodded. &#x201c;And something stronger for me.&#x201d; Featherby bowed and withdrew. Lady Beatrice pulled out her lorgnette and regarded Jane through it. &#x201c;Well now, you&#x2019;re full of surprises, miss.&#x201d;</p><p>Jane&#x2019;s jaw dropped. &#x201c;<i>I </i>am?&#x201d;</p><p>Lady Beatrice frowned. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t expect this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not entirely sure what &#x2018;this&#x2019; is.&#x201d; She glanced at Daisy. &#x201c;Daisy said Lord Cambury was making an offer. Of marriage. For me.&#x201d;</p><p>Lady Beatrice nodded. &#x201c;Nothing wrong with the gel&#x2019;s ears. Not that any of you should be listening at doors.&#x201d;</p><p>Daisy gave her an unrepentant grin. &#x201c;Best way to keep up with all the news.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Minx.&#x201d; The old lady shook her head, sending her vivid red curls bobbing. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re quite right.&#x201d; She turned to Jane. &#x201c;Lord Cambury has made a formal offer for your hand.&#x201d;</p><p>So it was true. Jane stared at her, stunned. &#x201c;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he hardly knows me.&#x201d; She tried to remember the times she&#x2019;d spoken to Lord Cambury, and could recall only the most commonplace exchanges&#x2014;a comment about the weather on one occasion, and her partiality for cream cakes on another.</p><p>&#x201c;And from the sounds of things, you don&#x2019;t know him either,&#x201d; Abby pointed out.</p><p>&#x201c;Nevertheless, it&#x2019;s an excellent offer,&#x201d; Lady Beatrice said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s rich, as rich as Golden Ball they say, only without the vulgarity. Lord Cambury prides himself on his exquisite good taste.&#x201d;</p><p>William, their footman, brought in the tea tray with a large pot of tea and a plate of cakes and other delicacies. Featherby followed, bearing the brandy decanter. Under Lady Beatrice&#x2019;s supervision, he poured her tea&#x2014;more brandy than tea.</p><p>Abby poured for the rest of them, just tea with a little milk. For a few moments the silence was broken only by the clattering of teacups and spoons.</p><p>&#x201c;What did you tell him?&#x201d; Jane blurted out as soon as William and Featherby had left.</p><p>&#x201c;That it was your decision, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s ridiculous,&#x201d; Abby declared. &#x201c;As if Jane would even consider such an insulting offer. So he&#x2019;s rich and a lord. Does he think he is so rich and important that he doesn&#x2019;t even have to bother courting her?&#x201d; She looked at Jane expectantly.</p><p>Jane said nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;Ridiculous, perhaps,&#x201d; Lady Beatrice said after a moment, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s quite a coup for your sister. The caps that have been set at Cambury these past ten years&#x2014;you have no idea, my dears&#x2014;and he&#x2019;s offered for Jane before the season has even begun!&#x201d;</p><p>She drained her cup and signaled for Abby to refill it with tea this time. &#x201c;Whether or not you accept him, your success is assured, my dear. What a season this is going to be! Two of you brilliantly married already and now, a magnificent offer for Jane&#x2014;and from Cambury, of all men.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you know about him?&#x201d; Jane asked.</p><p>There was a sudden silence.</p><p>Abby put the teapot down with a thump and turned to her sister. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be seriously considering him, Jane. You don&#x2019;t even know him&#x2014;you said as much yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I asked Lady Beatrice what she knows about him,&#x201d; Jane responded tranquilly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m curious.&#x201d; She glanced at Abby. &#x201c;I have a right to know, after all.&#x201d;</p><p>Abby bit her lip. &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>The old lady picked up her teacup and regarded Jane for a thoughtful mome...</p></p><h2>The Barefoot Sisters Southbound (Adventures on the Appalachian Trail)</h2><p>Rarely will you find books that explore the human emotions of a long-distance trek so honestly and clearly. --Roger Williamson, Campmor, Inc. <p>"Highly recommended." --trailsbib.blogspot.com </p><p>From the book: "We stood for a moment before the venerable signpost marking the summit. Scored with graffiti and the constant onslaught of weather, it stands perhaps three feet high, a wooden A-frame painted Forest Service brown with recessed white letters: <br>KATAHDIN 5268 ft.<br>Northern Terminus of the Appalachian Trail<br>Below this were a few waypoints: Thoreau Spring, 1.0, Katahdin Stream Campground, 5.2. At the bottom of the list: Springer Mountain, Georgia, 2160.2. More than two thousand miles. It was simply a number, too large and incomprehensible to have any bearing on me. The farthest I had ever walked in a day was ten miles and that was with a daypack. Now I was contemplating a journey of months, covering thousands of miles. All of a sudden, there on the summit with the clouds screaming past us, it didn't seem like such a great idea.<br>I turned to my sister, half-expecting to see the same doubt mirrored in her face. But her eyes were shining, and she smiled with an almost feral intensity. It was a look I would come to know all too well over the next year and a half, and it meant, I am going to do this and no one had better try to stop me. 'We're really doing this,' she shouted over the wind's howl and the lashing rain. 'We're hiking the Appalachian Trail!'" </p><p>At the ages of twenty-five and twenty-one, Lucy and Susan Letcher set out to accomplish what thousands of people attempt each year: thru-hike the entire 2,175 miles of the Appalachian Trail. The difference between them and the others? They decided to hike the trail barefoot. Quickly earning themselves the moniker of the Barefoot Sisters, the two begin their journey at Mount Katahdin and spend eight months making their way to Springer Mountain in Georgia. As they hike, they write about their adventures through the 100-mile Wilderness, the rocky terrain of Pennsylvania, and snowfall in the Great Smoky Mountains--a story filled with humor and determination. It's as close as one can get to hiking the Appalachian Trail without strapping on a pack.<br></p><p><br>Listen to the Barefoot Sisters read excerpts from their book here:<br>Southbound Podcast - part 1 <br>and here: <br>Southbound Podcast - part 2</p></p><p>Lucy Letcher is an artist and a writer.

The majority of scholars now believe that an understanding of verbal aspect is even more important than verb tense (past, present, etc.). Until now, however, there have been no accessible textbooks, both in terms of level and price (most titles on the topic retail for more than $100). In this book, Constantine Campbell investigates the function of verbal aspect within the New Testament Greek narrative. He has done a marvelous job in this book of simplifying the concept without getting caught up using terms of linguistics that no one except those schooled in that field can understand. The book includes exercises, an answer key, glossary of key concepts, an appendix covering space and time, and an index to Scripture cited. Professors and students, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, will use this is as a supplemental text in both beginning and advanced Greek courses. Pastors that study the Greek text will also appreciate this resource as a supplement to their preaching and teaching.</p></p><p>Constantine R. Campbell (PhD, Macquarie University) is Associate Professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Deerfield, Illinois. He is author of Paul and Union with Christ, Outreach and the Artist, Verbal Aspect, the Indicative Mood, and Narrative, Verbal Aspect and Non-Indicative Verbs, Not Ashamed, Basics of Verbal Aspect in Biblical Greek, and Keep Your Greek. Dr Campbell is a public speaker, musician, and author, and lives in Chicago.&#x201c;This is the accessible treatment of verbal aspect we have been waiting for! In a field which can be over-technical, Dr Campbell has provided a lucid, readable and short introduction which will be enormously helpful for students and their professors. His explanations of concepts are very clear, his model of how to move from aspect to kind of action portrayed is wonderfully useful, and his examples are very well chosen. Bravo!&#x201d; -- Steve Walton<br><br>&#x201c;Campbell and I agree on at least one major point regarding verbal aspect---understanding Greek verbal aspect is crucial for understanding the Greek of the New Testament. For too long such knowledge has been woefully lacking among commentators and other students of the New Testament. One cannot exegete the text responsibly without applying an accurate understanding of Greek verbal aspect. If this book helps students and scholars to realize this crucial point, it will have accomplished its purpose.&#x201d; -- Stanley E. Porter<br><br>&#x201c;Dr Campbell's masterly introduction to verbal aspect in Biblical Greek will be appreciated by teachers and students of the New Testament alike. His clear explanation of this complex but important subject, the pertinent examples he provides, and how verbal aspect contributes to our exegesis and translation, all make this volume a must for those who want to study the New Testament in Greek.&#x201d; -- Peter T. O'Brien<br><br>&#x201c;This is a book which I wish I had had the foresight (and time!) to write. . . . This volume extends the discussion further by including a systematic method for working with both aspect and Aktionsart. This is the first time this has been done to my knowledge and the result, though not exhaustive, appears to provide a sane and solid foundation for using both these theoretical constructs in a complementary way for New Testament exegesis.&#x201d; -- Rodney J. Decker<br><br>&#x201c;Students of New Testament Greek have for years been wrestling with middle-level and advanced volumes unpacking verbal aspect. Something of a revolution has taken place during the last two decades. What has been lacking, however, has been an accessible introduction to the subject. Here it is! With limpid prose, logical development, and helpful examples, Con Campbell has put countless teachers and students in his debt.&#x201d; -- D. A. Carson<br><br>&#x201c;An accessible introduction to the question of aspect and time, comfortably hitting a center position that sees aspect as primary, but time as still important, and yet not oversimplifying the debate. This is an excellent place to start investigating this important issue.&#x201d; -- William D. Mounce, Author</p><h2>A Child&#39;s Christmas in Wales (Godine Storyteller)</h2><p><b><i>THIS IS THE HARDCOVER OF THE BELOVED GODINE CLASSIC EDITION</i></b><p></p><p>Of all the modern holiday classics, this is perhaps the best known and best loved. In humorous, sonorous, nostalgic prose, Dylan Thomas recalls the church-going, the tree-trimming, the food, the carols and games, not of one childhood Christmas but of them all: he distills here the Perfect Dream of Christmas. For this edition, the immortal Edward Ardizzone produced 30 delightful watercolors and drawings (and if you're clever you can recognize Cardiff as the Welsh town in which the story is set) as a perfect counterpoint to Thomas's lilting words.</p><p></p><p>"...It's the sheer acrobatic brilliance of the language here that we most love. This is the most delicious read-aloud for having words trip off the tongue." - Elizabeth Bluemle, Publisher's Weekly</p></p><p>Dylan Thomas was born in Swansea in October 1914, the son of a senior English master. On leaving school he worked on the South Wales Evening Post before embarking on his literary career in London. Not only a poet, he wrote short stories, film scripts, features and radio plays, the most famous being Under Milk Wood. He died in November 1953, shortly after his thirty-ninth birthday. He is buried in Laugharne, Carmarthenshire, which had become his main home since 1949. Edward Ardizzone was born October 16, 1900 in Haiphong, French Indochina (now Vietnam) and moved to England when he was five years old. He wrote and illustrated the story of Little Tim and the Brave Sea Captain for his own children; Oxford University Press published it in 1935 with great success. This book led to several more in the popular &#34;Tim&#34; series. Ardizzone won the first Kate Greenaway Medal in 1956 for Tim All Alone and was named Commander, Order of British Empire in 1971. He died in 1979.Text: English (translation) <br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Mexico in Revolution, 1912-1920 (Reacting to the Past)</h2><p><p><strong>Part of the <em>Reacting to the Past</em> series, <strong><em>Mexico in Revolution, 1912&#x2013;1920</em></strong> invites students to stabilize Mexico&#x2019;s fragile government and debate a variety of reforms</strong></p> The year is 1912, and Francisco Madero is president of Mexico.

The Handbook engages in a comprehensive examination of themes and approaches, guiding the reader through current debates and literatures in the context of the historical development of systematic theological reflection. Organized thematically, it treats in detail the full array of topics in systematic theology, as well as questions of its sources and norms, its relation to other theological and non-theological fields of enquiry, and some major trends in current work. Each chapter provides an analysis of research and debate on its topic. The focus is on doctrinal (rather than historical) questions, and on major (rather than ephemeral) debates. The aim is to stimulate readers to reach theological judgements on the basis of consideration of the range of opinion. Drawn from Europe, the UK, and North America, the authors are all leading practitioners of the discipline. Readers will find expert guidance as well as creative suggestions about the future direction of the study of Christian doctrine.<br></p><p>John Webster is Professor of Systematic Theology at the University of Aberdeen.

In this free-wheeling novel of epic proportions,&nbsp;William T. Vollmann&nbsp;has crafted a biting, hilarious satire of history, technology, politics, and misguided love. In the jungles of South America, on the ice fields of Alaska, the plains of the Midwest, and the streets of San Francisco, a fearsome battle rages. The insects are vying for world domination; the inventors of electricity stand in evil opposition. Bug , a young man, rebels against his own kind and joins forces with the insects. Wayne, a thug, allies himself with the malevolent forces of electricity and vows to assassinate the preying mantis who tends bar in Oregon.</p><p>William T. Vollmann is the author of ten novels, including <i>Europe Central</i>, which won the National Book Award.&nbsp; He has also written four collections of stories, including <i>The</i> <i>Atlas</i>, which won the PEN Center USA West Award for Fiction, a memoir, and six works of nonfiction, including <i>Rising Up and Rising Down</i> and <i>Imperial</i>, both of which were finalists for the National Book Critics Circle Award. He is the recipient of a Whiting Writers Award and the Strauss Living Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.&nbsp; His journalism and fiction have been published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Harpers</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Granta</i>, and many other publications.In this surrealistic allegory, America is populated exclusively by revolutionaries and reactionaries. The reactionaries are led by the mysterious Society of Daniel, a group of electrical engineers who worship the sacred Book of Generators. The revolutionaries, humanoid insects who pledge allegiance to the Great Beetle, are united by a common experience of torture at the hands of crewcut bullies. Vollmann calls the book a cartoon, and although he clearly sympathizes with the radicals, they are, after all, only bugs. In addition to an undigested mass of information about power plants, entomology, and hand guns, there is a lot of good writing herebut not nearly enough to fill 600 pages. With better editing this might have been outstanding. As it stands, it is a fascinating flop, but one that readers interested in experimental fiction will want to take a look at. Edward B.

Lachmann explains why the United States will not be able to sustain its global dominance, and contrasts America's relatively brief period of hegemony with the Netherlands' similarly short primacy and Britain's far longer era of leadership.<br><br>Decline in all those cases was not inevitable and did not respond to global capitalist cycles. Rather, decline is the product of elites' success in grabbing control over resources and governmental powers. Not only are ordinary people harmed, but also capitalists become increasingly unable to coordinate their interests and adopt policies and make investments necessary to counter economic and geopolitical competitors elsewhere in the world.<br><br>Conflicts among elites and challenges by non-elites determine the timing and mold the contours of decline. Lachmann traces the transformation of US politics from an era of elite consensus to present-day paralysis combined with neoliberal plunder, explains the paradox of an American military with an unprecedented technological edge unable to subdue even the weakest enemies, and the consequences of finance's cannibalization of the US economy.</p><p><b>Richard Lachmann</b> is Professor at the University of Albany-SUNY and is the author of <i>Capitalists In Spite of Themselves: Elite Conflict and Economic Transitions in Early Modern Europe</i> (Oxford, 2000), <i>States and Power</i> (Polity 2010) and <i>What Is Historical Sociology?</i> (Polity 2013).&#x201c;&#x2018;Hegemonic decline,&#x2019; to borrow a phrase from one of Trump&#x2019;s ancestors, makes one want to release the safety catch on one&#x2019;s Browning. A petrified debate whose time had come and gone ... or so I believed until I opened Lachmann. This is a highly original synthesis that blends world systems theory and comparative history with an astute analysis of contemporary US politics to draw powerful and uncomfortable conclusions.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Mike Davis</b><br><br>&#x201c;One of the most important developments in recent times is the American elites&#x2019; loss of influence in global affairs, concurrent with its consolidation of power at home. In this brilliant, sweeping analysis, Richard Lachmann connects the dots and explains how the two processes are related. Placing the United States in the context of its imperial predecessors, he helps us understand America&#x2019;s place in the rogues&#x2019; gallery of global powers. And most importantly, he helps us see that the American oligarchs will be perfectly happy to see the rest of the nation sink, if that&#x2019;s what it takes to hold on to their dwindling possessions. A work of great depth and moral clarity, it deserves the widest possible audience.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Vivek Chibber</b><br><br>&#x201c;In this historically deep and richly cross-national study of empires and hegemons, Richard Lachmann brings forth new information and a highly original analysis to cast a bright light on the United States and its likely future. Whether social scientists and historians are inclined to agree with him or not, they will have to deal with the fact that his analysis shows that all of them are at least partially wrong about empires and hegemons in one way or another.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;G. William Domhoff, Distinguished Professor Emeritus and Research Professor, University of California, Santa Cruz</b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a powerful, often brilliant, comparative account of the rise and especially the decline of hegemonic powers, focusing most on the Netherlands, Britain, and the United States. Emphasis is placed on the way in which competing elites within the hegemon pursue their own narrow interests to block effective coping with decline. Particularly sobering and convincing is the bleak outlook presented for the future of the United States.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Michael Mann, Distinguisher Research Professor, UCLA, author of <i>The Sources of Social Power</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Working on a strikingly broad comparative canvass Lachmann bridges two genres that are usually widely separate: serious comparative historical sociology, and public engagement. His book asks &#x2018;what is the connection between the structure of elite relations and the durability of hegemony, understood as a form of power in which the leadership of the dominant group is &#x201c;perceived by subordinate groups as serving a more general interest&#x201d;?&#x2019; Hegemons, unlike simple empires, set the global rules of the game. Their power &#x2018;thus ... extends beyond their formal and informal territorial possessions to encompass the entire world.&#x2019; Lachmann&#x2019;s answer to this question is that hegemony is possible where there exist plural elites combined with a low level of elite conflict. Where, in contrast, elites are singular (as in the Nazi or Napoleonic empires) or where there is a high level of conflict (as in the Absolutist cases), hegemony is impossible. In the first sort of case elites simply dominate the lands that they conquer in order to extract resources without gaining any local allies. In the second case elites entrench their own interests at the expense of the general interest; they thus become &#x2018;autarkic&#x2019; and their own interests split apart from the general interest. This brilliant book, written in the venerable tradition of C. Wright Mills, will be of interest to a wide range of scholars and to the educated public at large. Lachmann shows that comparative and historical sociology is alive and kicking.

Scofield is on the faculty of the Solstice MFA Program in Creative Writing at Pine Manor College and has for many years taught in the University of Iowa Summer Writing Festival.The Novel Continuum<br><br> My students and workshop participants often refer to novels in a binary way. They think of novels as being either popular (commercial) or literary (artful). It's a false comparison that sets you up to feel defensive. And it underestimates readers.<br><br> "I want to write a book that people read!" I hear.<br><br> "I'm not going to sell out quality!" says someone else.<br><br> "I like my genre," I hear from students, as if I'm going to say there's something wrong with fantasy, crime, or romance. (In our MFA program, we have a preponderance of fantasy and crime novelists!)<br><br> But no one says, "I'm going to write schlock." No one says, "I'm writing for forty readers."<br><br> Because what we all want is to write with intelligence, imagination, and compassion. We want to be read and we want to be good. We don't expect to be read by everyone, but we have a sense of the readership we would like to have.<br><br> Back in the dark ages when I was in high school, lots of teachers graded on something called the "curve." The idea was that at one end of an imaginary line were the idiots who didn't study and who deserved F's. At the other end were the prissy nerds and natural geniuses who of course got A's. Everyone else was somewhere on the continuum between those ends, and the most common grade was right in the middle, the C. I think that approach has fallen off&#x2014;I hope so&#x2014;but it suggests something useful for our purposes, this idea of a continuum.<br><br> Let's forget A and F, because on our continuum we aren't making harsh judgments; we aren't going from bad to good. We're just saying that there are fewer books at each end of the line, and more as we move to the middle, which I think of as mainstream. Where most of us want to be is in the middle of this bell curve, where more books are sold. In that hump are books that have qualities from both ends&#x2014;from the likely-to-be-read and the likely-to-be-respected categories. The agent Donald Maass talks about the "breakout novel" as the one that has such a powerful story that it appeals to a mass readership, while it also is written so well that it is admired for its artistry. This may mean a genre writer with a good audience writes something that a broader audience appreciates. It might mean that a literary writer with a small admiring audience writes something that appeals to many more readers. Every season, there is almost always a writer with a backlist of good books who, for whatever reason, suddenly hits the sweet spot and earns a large audience. Hilary Mantel has been turning out terrific novels for decades, but it's Thomas Cromwell who brought her fame. And of course there are writers with large audiences of readers who don't care about the issues I'm raising&#x2014;they just want a good story, and they don't care that the same writers get critical attention. Anne Tyler is a prime example, with consistent best sellers and lots of graduate papers about her writing. Consider Jane Smiley (<i>A Thousand Acres</i>), Cormac McCarthy (<i>All the Pretty Horses</i>), and Ian McEwan (<i>Atonement</i>).<br><br> That said, not everyone wants to be in the middle. Some writers have a very nice niche, where they write book after book for readers who seem to be lined up waiting. If that niche has a lot of book buyers, we call the book popular. If that niche garners awards and warm critical reviews, we call it literary. I think there's no reason at all to worry about where you are on this continuum, except to know what you do best, and do it. At the same time, I think that many fine literary writers want very much to enlarge their audience, and that it's a big day when they do. Think of the British writer Kate Atkinson melding mainstream sales and widespread critical praise with her novels <i>Life After Life</i> and <i>A God in Ruins</i>. She was already well-known and respected. Her most popular books were mysteries. Then she wrote two novels in which the whole idea of one person living one life was tossed out the window in favor of diced chronology and impossible history and a whole new way of conceiving of a person's time and fate, and suddenly she's both a literary star and a best seller on multiple continents. She came up with something new, and she wrote it with great craftsmanship. Justin Cronin came out of the gate with solid literary novels&#x2014;and then he wrote a spectacularly successful vampire trilogy.<br><br> Or consider Stephen King, as well-known as any writer in the world, writing horror and suspense, year after year; and suddenly I'm reading reviews about how innovative he is, how he's more than a genre writer. (I think he would say he's fine with being a genre writer. Who has had a better career?)<br><br> So I'm going to chance a description of two sorts of novels, reminding you with full throat that either one is good if it's a good story, well written. And I say again that what you want is to be as good as you can be at what you do&#x2014;which almost surely means drawing on both ends of the continuum. (I'll go out on a limb: I think writers of literary fiction have the most to learn from the middle, and the most to gain, but any novel is enhanced by having a resonant theme and a complex protagonist.) Think about the novels you love; I'll bet you they can be described with phrases from both categories. Which is why this common dichotomy is ultimately a false one.<br><br> "Popular" novels are usually written with a comfortable, unobtrusive voice. They are well plotted and present a question that begs to be answered. The settings can be familiar, cozy, domestic (like much women's fiction), or quite exotic. The reader easily identifies with the main character. There is clear conflict and rising action. There are surprises, but there is also a sense of inexorability. The reader is engaged, maybe reading fast, but never confused. If there is mystery, it is because it is a mystery. The resolution is satisfying&#x2014;it has some surprise in it, but at the same time, it's just what ought to happen. There are external forces at work, often including a powerful villain, but the most interesting complications arise because of the protagonist's choices&#x2014;usually in response to heightened danger or failure&#x2014;which push the plot along. Memory and psychology often explain or drive character problems, sometimes simplistically (the woman abused as a child despises men; the impoverished child grows up to be CEO of a multinational corporation), and there is usually a big scene of revelation. Structure is clear, often schematic, so that the reader can follow story complications. There is always a sympathetic protagonist, but there are often alternating or multiple points of view. Some novels have almost no interiority (think of Elmore Leonard, with his rapid-fire dialogue); others are drenched in it (Jodi Picoult), appealing to different tastes in the readership. The voice of the novel may be dispassionate, focused on the action; or the voice may be highly individual, reflecting the protagonist (especially if in first person), or reflecting the diction of the writer. Scenes take up most of the real estate of the book. Read several books by a popular author and you can probably write a blueprint for writing such a novel. (Though that doesn't mean you will necessarily have the right ideas! It takes talent to write a book that has mass appeal.)<br><br> When does this kind of writing "go too far," in my estimation? When the characters are flat; they might have been lifted from somebody else's story, or from an earlier book by the same author. When the explanations for character behavior are obvious or corny or not there at all. When it's all excitement and gore, sex and burning swords, and I'm not made to care about anybody. When pop psychology is milked for explanation. When I've seen it all before. When the language is trite, dull, or, worst of all, full of errors in diction and syntax.<br><br> To be fair, though, I see two exceptions to my reservations about popular writing. One is that even though genres have apparent rules, those rules can be broken. This is much more true now than it used to be, when bodice rippers had shirtless Italian male models on the cover. When someone talented and ambitious cracks the genre with a fresh interpretation and a great voice&#x2014;I'm thinking of Jennifer Weiner here&#x2014;it not only means success for that writer, it means a whole new genre spreads like wildfire. Likewise, when a writer writes an entertaining novel that is totally out of his expected "territory," it is fodder for publicity: <i>Rich and Pretty</i> is an entertaining story (a "beach read") about childhood female best friends all grown up in New York City&#x2014;written by Rumaan Alam, a first-generation American son of South Asian parents.<br><br> The other exception to my basic description of popular fiction is self-published books that may be riddled with glaring problems, but drenched with the kind of story there is an audience for, especially science fiction, fantasy, and romance. Hundreds of thousands of readers don't give diddly whether participles dangle or dialogue apes bad movies. They love the stories. Writers of such books seem to write spontaneously, magically, but I bet even they would be surprised at what they could do with a little more craft and reflection. Alas, they may not have time for it, or think the time worth investing.<br><br> "Literary" novels spring from an artistic impulse. Story is usually driven more by character than by plot. There is a heightened attention to language, and often an innovative structure. There is a powerful theme, sometimes disturbing, about things that matter to the culture as well as the individual. There is a sense of largeness; the story connects with the "gift of second meaning," by which I mean that you find yourself rereading passages because you know there is something more there for you to understand. You are willing to read the book again so you can think about it more. You read a page several times because it's just so darned beautiful. You lend it to a friend, but you want it back.<br><br> Think layers. The characters are complex. The voice is unique. Memory and psychology may provide templates or motifs, but they are used with subtlety. There is a powerful premise; the story says something about the world as it is, as it could be, as it will never be. There is a strong sense of the "created world of story"; not that it isn't plausible, but somehow it's more elegant than real life. It manages, all at once, to seem both compressed and capacious. There may be a kind of authorial presence, casting philosophical light on the story and on life in general. Vocabulary is elevated. Sentence structure is varied, playful, sophisticated, or maybe crisp and clear and spare. There's more contemplation, more musing, than in a mainstream novel. Less snap.<br><br> When does this kind of novel "go too far"? When the play with language gets in the way of following a story. When the construct is too precious by far. When I get the feeling the writer didn't really care whether I could follow his thought or not. When there's so much narrator talk that I lose interest in the story, if I can find it. When it seems to be merely emulating another writer. When it's just not to my taste. Yet I could name writers who made great careers with books I found impossibly dull and arch and contrived. I have to believe that they knew what they were doing and decided early on to take what they could get, following their talents. Sure enough, they found their audience. There are so many readers, so many tastes. So many possibilities.<br><br> <i>Think about what kind of book you want to write. Set your bar high.</i> Draw from these descriptions the characteristics you will strive for. Really, I mean it: Make a list. Don't expect to get everything right on the first pass. You can learn to write better. I suggest as a starter list: clear, fluent, modestly adorned diction&#x2014;error free, without being a smarty-pants; an idea that feels new and excites you; a well-constructed story line that comes together satisfactorily but not too early and not with tricks; someone to love; something to be afraid of; something to learn; the warmth of a storyteller's voice. Build on your strengths. If one of them isn't language, then learn to be correct. That will suffice. Make time to practice sentence craft; there are many books to help you. Find models, and practice writing passages like them. Write with restraint. Stay out of your own way.<br><br> And try this: Pick a novel you admire a lot and describe what you like. Is it reasonable to think you could write a book that had similar qualities? Or is it more likely that your eclectic taste includes books you would never write? If the second thing is true, question your assumption. Dig deeper into your own response. Maybe you are awed by the author's language and wit, but what really reaches you is a quality of the story that you could indeed aim for in your own writing. So you aren't Flaubert. That doesn't mean that you can't tell a story about a sad, foolish, passionate, deluded woman who somehow touches all of us who have impossible dreams, if that's the story you have in you. You aren't Cormac McCarthy. But maybe you believe that boys become men when they survive harsh adventure, and you know an adventure that would make a heck of a story. Maybe you are in love with the quotidian&#x2014;you think everyday life is full of muted drama and that's what captures you emotionally. (Be patient, it takes some luck for that kind of novel to rise to the top, but it happens. How about Anne Tyler? Jane Hamilton? Meg Wolitzer? Kent Haruf? Tony Earley? Richard Russo?) Maybe you love the way an author integrates history into the story, or sets the protagonist in a sprawling family. You could do those things&#x2014;about your subject, with your own sensibility.<i> Story is the key.</i><br><br> If plotting is hard for you, pick a fairly short novel with a straightforward chronology, and take it apart. Think like an architect. Study archetypal plots, the plots of classic novels; practice by inventing your own versions in summary form. Then look at your summaries and find a way to upend the archetype. Look around you and keep asking questions&#x2014;<i>What if? What else?</i>&#x2014;because the best stories aren't labored; they spring from basic human needs and fears made new by imagination.</p><h2>Survival Kit for New Christians - Basic English</h2><p><p><b>Survival Kit for New Christians - Basic English</b> helps new believers in Jesus Christ as Savior understand and win over problems in their lives.

In the <i>Summa</i> Aquinas works to save and purify the thought of the Greeks and the Arabs in the higher light of Christian Revelation, confident that all that had been rational in the ancient philosophers and their followers would become more rational within Christianity. This exposition and defense of divine truth has two main parts: the consideration of that truth that faith professes and reason investigates, and the consideration of the truth that faith professes and reason is not competent to investigate. The exposition of truths accessible to natural reason occupies Aquinas in the first three books of the <i>Summa</i>. His method is to bring forward demonstrative and probable arguments, some of which are drawn from the philosophers, to convince the skeptic. In the fourth book of the <i>Summa</i> St. Thomas appeals to the authority of the Sacred Scripture for those divine truths that surpass the capacity of reason. The present volume is the second part of a treatise on the hierarchy of creation, the divine providence over all things, and man&#x2019;s relation to God. Book 1 of the <i>Summa</i> deals with God; Book 2, Creation; and Book 4, Salvation.</p><p>St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) is a Doctor of the church.

That is the message of this 18th-century inspirational classic by Jean-Pierre de Caussade. Its encouragement to live in the present moment, accepting everyday obstacles with humility and love, has guided generations of seekers to spiritual peace and holiness. In this timeless spiritual classic, de Caussade presents the simple, profound gospel message that Jesus lived and taught: My meat is to do the will of my Father in heaven. The author states, The will of God gives to all things a supernatural and divine value for the soul submitting to it. The duties it imposes and those it contains become holy and perfect because everything it touches shares its divine character.This special volume of the famous spiritual treatise also includes the many insightful letters of Father de Caussade on the practice of self-abandonment. These numerous letters provide a great additional source of wisdom and much practical guidance for how to grow in abandonment and to deepen our union with God in our daily lives.De Caussade shows that this practice of self-abandonment to God&#39;s will is the key to attaining true peace and virtue, and that it is readily available to all people - from beginners to those well advanced in the spiritual life. He also shows how to determine what God&#39;s will is for us. He reveals that it is not extraordinary feats that God expects for our growth in holiness, but rather heroic attention to every detail in our lives and humble acceptance of our daily lot in life as coming from His hand. The rich spiritual lessons in this book have stood the test of time, offering real and practical assistance to all people because its message is simple and clear, one that the reader will find to be a rare treasure of inspiration and direction to be referred to again and again.</p><p>Fr. Jean Pierre de Caussade (1675-1751) was a French Jesuit priest and author, most well-known for his famous treatise on Abandonment to Divine Providence, and also his letters to the Visitation nuns, where he served as confessor and spiritual director. He also served as the rector of two colleges, and as spiritual director for a Jesuit house. He was deeply influenced by the writings of both St. Francis de Sales and St. John of the Cross.In his famous classic, Father de Caussade makes one point, and illustrates it in many different ways. That point is: do the will of God to the best of your ability and you will attain peace of soul here and life everlasting hereafter. Extra value of the new Ignatius Press edition is the inclusion of de Caussade's wonderful letters of spiritual advice. The letters offer many concrete examples of how to find God's will in your life and how to put it into practice. This classic belongs in every spiritual library. --<b>Fr.

Turner</h2><p><b>The life of one of Western art's most admired and misunderstood painters</b><br> &nbsp;<br>J.M.W. Turner is one of the most important figures in Western art, and his visionary work paved the way for a revolution in landscape painting. Over the course of his lifetime, Turner strove to liberate painting from an antiquated system of patronage. Bringing a new level of expression and color to his canvases, he paved the way for the modern artist.<br> &nbsp;<br> Turner was very much a man of his changing era. In his lifetime, he saw Britain ravaged by Napoleonic wars, revived by the Industrial Revolution, and embarked upon a new moment of Imperial glory with the ascendancy of Queen Victoria. His own life embodied astonishing transformation. Born the son of a barber in Covent Garden, he was buried amid pomp and ceremony in St. Paul's Cathedral. <br> &nbsp;<br> Turner was accepted into the prestigious Royal Academy at the height of the French Revolution when a climate of fear dominated Britain. Unable to travel abroad he explored at home, reimagining the landscape to create some of the most iconic scenes of his country. But his work always had a profound human element. When a moment of peace allowed travel into Europe, Turner was one of the first artists to capture the beauty of the Alps, to revive Venice as a subject, and to follow in Byron&#x2019;s footsteps through the Rhine country.<br> &nbsp;<br> While he was commercially successful for most of his career, Turner's personal life remained fraught. His mother suffered from mental illness and was committed to Bedlam. &nbsp;Turner never married but had several long-term mistresses and illegitimate daughters. His erotic drawings were numerous but were covered up by prurient Victorians after his death.<br> &nbsp;<br> Turner's late, impressionistic work was held up by his Victorian detractors as example of a creeping madness. Affection for the artist&#x2019;s work soured. John Ruskin, the greatest of all 19th century art critics, did what he could to rescue Turner&#x2019;s reputation, but Turner&#x2019;s very last works confounded even his greatest defender. <br> &nbsp;<br> TURNER humanizes this surprising genius while placing him in his fascinating historical context. Franny Moyle brilliantly tells the story of the man to give us an astonishing portrait of the artist and a vivid evocation of Britain and Europe in flux.</p><p>Franny Moyle studied Art History at St John's College, Cambridge. She enjoyed a career in arts programming at the BBC that culminated in her becoming the corporation's first Commissioner for Arts and Culture. She is now a freelance executive producer and writer and lives in east London. She is the author of <i>Constance: The Tragic and Scandalous Life of Mrs Oscar Wilde </i>and <i>Desperate Romantics: The Private Lives of the Pre-Raphaelites</i>.1. Admiral Booth<br><br>A wet, wintry day in mid-December 1851. The man from Mrs Foord's frame-makers stood in the rain and knocked on the door of 47 Queen Anne Street in Marylebone, the professional address of the most famous living British artist, J. M. W. Turner RA. Foord's man had work to do there.<br><br>'Turner's Den', as it had become known, looked more like the premises of a painter long dead than the workplace of a living legend. The quiet classical frontage, which once sat respectably alongside the street's other examples of Georgian restraint, had been let go. The windows were filthy, their cracked panes patched with paper. The paint on the front door had blistered and the iron palisades were rusty.<br><br>A short hag of a woman answered the frame-maker's knock. Her large head was draped with a piece of flannel, striving to conceal a nasty skin affliction. This was Hannah Danby, Turner's long-time housekeeper. She led Foord's man into a square vestibule barely illuminated by the neglected arched windows to either side of the door, which had become caked with dust. The hall was an empty brown space, bereft of ornament.<br><br>As he followed Danby upstairs, the gothic adventure continued. The tradesman was led into the top-lit custom-made gallery where Turner's paintings were displayed. The rain was 'flooding in by the skylight', Foord's man would later remember. 'Turner would not pay for plaster - so they had to put paper as well as they could - several pictures damaged.'<br><br>Foord's man saw nothing of Turner himself the day he worked in his rain-soaked gallery. This was not unusual. The old painter had become increasingly retiring in his dotage, and over the last twelve months or so had even begun absenting himself from his business engagements at the Royal Academy.<br><br>For Hannah Danby, however, it was less her master's absence from his professional commitments that was of concern. It was his absence from his own home that was causing her considerable anxiety in December 1851. The seventy-six-year-old Turner had not set foot in Queen Anne Street since June. This was not entirely out of character for a man who for the last five years had, clearly, been keeping a second home, and from whom she was used to receiving instructions via the postboy. But as Christmas approached, Hannah Danby was beginning to fret. She did not know exactly where her master's second home was, and she sensed something was wrong. She began to search for anything that might suggest its location. A letter discovered in a coat pocket with a Chelsea address was what she needed.<br><br>And so on 16 December Hannah Danby sought out a friend, probably Maria Tanner, the woman who assisted her in the care, such as it was, of Queen Anne Street, and the two of them headed south to Chelsea. They found themselves on the stinking Cremorne New Road, a small lane along the Thames that ran from the old wooden Battersea Bridge to the Cremorne Jetty, where penny fares brought revellers by steamboat to the Pleasure Gardens of the same name.<br><br>Skirting a muddy foreshore, smelling of the open drains that spilled into the river and peppered with dogs and chickens picking their way through the flotsam and jetsam of the river, Cremorne New Road presented a sharp contrast to the grandiose streets of the West End. Nevertheless, here, facing the timber yards and chemical works of Battersea, was a row of cottages that made up Davis Place. And at No. 6, between Alexander the boat builder and a couple of beer sellers, she found a modest yellow brick house, dating from the 1750s.<br><br>Despite the seedy location, it was charming enough in its own way - a three-storey, mid-terrace house, fronted by a low wooden picket fence and gate that contained a cottage garden, it betrayed the personal touches of domesticity that accompany a lengthy tenancy. A wooden lattice porch over the front door housed potted plants and a caged starling. The property's three front-facing windows all had lovingly planted window-boxes, and creepers had been allowed to grow up from one of them and crawl over the uppermost reaches of the fa?ade. But most significantly, in contrast to the neighbouring houses, No. 6 had been customized, at no little expense, to accommodate a high-level balcony or viewing platform, which, cut into the roof and contained by wrought-iron rails, offered an artist a bird's-eye view of London's river stretching out below.<br><br>But Turner was not on his platform the day Danby called. And though she quickly ascertained from neighbours that a man fitting her master's description was at home, she also discovered from the hushed tones and shaken heads that they believed he was dying. On hearing this news, Hannah could not bring herself to go in. Instead, distraught, she determined to seek the assistance of Turner's cousin and solicitor, Henry Harpur.<br><br>Henry Harpur lived in Lambeth. He was seventeen years his cousin's junior. The Harpurs and the Turners were strongly entwined. They shared not just blood, but plenty of family business, not least the final revisions Turner made to his will. They had also travelled together on the Continent. On 17 December he visited Chelsea at Hannah Danby's request.<br><br>The interior of the little house in Chelsea was modestly furnished, though its few contents reflected the interests of its occupant. The Art Journal and Illustrated London News were on the parlour table; the walls were hung with engravings. Here, on the uppermost storey, Harpur found the old painter in a soporific haze, having been spoon-fed for the past few days a diet of milk and brandy. He had lost all ability to talk. The bird-like man, whose intense gaze and beaky nose had once complemented a robust, if short, square frame, was now a mere waif, ebbing away. He was being nursed by plump and homely Sophia Booth, the woman who shared his life at No. 6 Davis Place. She was a widow, more than twenty years the painter's junior.<br><br>Harpur grasped the seriousness of Turner's condition immediately and knew that he must begin to prepare the world for the departure of one of its most eminent men. The very next day, 18 December, he wrote to Turner's long-time family friend, the architect Philip Hardwick, warning him that Turner's demise was imminent. Hardwick, now turning sixty, white-haired and balding, was the spitting image of his own father, who had known Turner as a boy. Like the Harpurs, the Hardwicks had shared a long history with the Turners.<br><br>A day later another note from Harpur was in Hardwick's hand. Turner was dead. He had passed away at 10 a.m. on 19 December. Hardwick had been deprived of the opportunity of saying goodbye to a friend who had known him man and boy. But on 19 December Harpur, no longer constrained by his eminent cousin's instructions, furnished Hardwick with the details of the whereabouts of the body. Hardwick alone was afforded this privilege and he went straight away to Davis Place to say his goodbye.<br><br>Harpur met Hardwick at the little house in Chelsea. It must have become immediately clear to both men that the circumstances of Turner's death could, if not properly managed, erupt into a national scandal that would eclipse the plaudits for his extraordinary work and compromise his ardent desire to be buried in honour in St Paul's Cathedral. After all, Turner had not only been discovered in an insalubrious location, in an undisclosed second home, he had also been discovered living in what much later would be described as a state of 'moral degradation'. Taken alongside his recent reclusivity, and the state of affairs in Queen Anne Street, this new twist in Turner's story was an unwelcome one. Were it to become public knowledge, it would only add fuel to the persistent theories in circulation that the old painter had lost his mind during the course of the last decade.<br><br>These allegations of madness had been prompted by what his public considered the increasingly bizarre and indecipherable paintings Turner had produced across the 1840s, works that critics were not afraid to condemn as utter 'abortions'. For the last decade he had turned out canvases that explored light, and the elements, in unique and highly experimental ways. Ships rocked, whales thrashed, and trains sped through raging storms and whirling mists that were unlike anything that had been presented to the public before. In what often felt like dreamscapes, the sunsets and sunrises he had once been so famed for painting with delicate luminosity had become substantive. His ghostlike characters were no longer bathed in light but swept up by it, in a parallel world of fog and fiery chaos.<br><br>Harpur understood only too well that if the true circumstances of Turner's death were to become widely known, it would be all too easy for the public to dismiss his final decade of toil and experiment. How convenient for Turner's critics to be able to confirm that the exquisite painter had indeed departed some ten years previously, leaving just this Chelsea relic to finish his career. A reputation already much dented was on the cusp of being roundly destroyed. Turner's fame was on the point of tipping into infamy.<br><br>As Hardwick left Davis Place he took with him a letter he saw that Turner had written to the stockbroker Charles Stokes. Apart from being a close friend, Stokes, a man now well into his sixties, had been both a dedicated collector of Turner's work for many years, and a business associate who oversaw some financial matters for him.<br><br>'Dear Stokes,' Turner had written. 'Enclosed is a wish for Mr F Marsh to advance on my account �100. I do not like the debts of Mr Woods - not paid. Have the goodness to do it.' These were almost certainly the last lines the artist wrote.<br><br>Now Hardwick scribbled his own postscript. 'Knowing the interest you have taken in all matters connected with Mr Turner,' he wrote, 'I thought you should be informed that we have lost him.' The letter reached Stokes's rooms at 4 Verulam Buildings, Gray's Inn Road, the very next day, 20 December.<br><br>As Stokes grieved in Gray's Inn, the news of Turner's death spread further through his closest circle. On 21 December, a stormy Sunday, another black-bordered envelope found its way to Denmark Hill. John James Ruskin returned wet and wind-swept from church to find correspondence from Thomas Griffith, Turner's agent. Griffith explained that he had not wanted Ruskin to discover news of Turner's demise in print.<br><br>John James Ruskin was exactly the same age as Charles Stokes. Both had been born in 1785, and were ten years Turner's junior. Like Stokes, Ruskin considered himself a friend of the artist. Ruskin had built a considerable fortune as a wine merchant, and with it he had indulged his son John's passion for Turner's work. John Ruskin junior had adored Turner's painting since he was a boy. As an undergraduate at Oxford he had written a defining defence of the artist's work that had launched his own career as the most pre-eminent art critic of his generation. Thanks to his father's generosity, he now had twenty-five watercolours as well as two oil paintings by the artist - a collection that at this stage still hung in the family home.<br><br>From the elder Ruskin's point of view at least, the timing of Turner's passing was somewhat ironic. Just three days earlier he had been bidding at Southgate and Barrett's Christmas sale for a watercolour by Turner, of Carisbrooke Castle, on the Isle of Wight. That evening, the Fleet Street sale-room had been packed to the brim with dealers and collectors. But Ruskin, a man who had not become rich by spending his money freely, had sent his picture framer to bid for him, under express instruction not to pay above fifty guineas for the work, only to see it go to a dealer prepared to pay �80.<br><br>On reading Griffith's note John James now sat down solemnly, in front of another of Turner's watercolours that hung at Denmark Hill. It was The Red Rigi, painted nearly a decade earlier, a depiction of the mountain that dominates Lake Lucerne in Switzerland, bathed in a fiery red evening glow. And then he picked up his pen to write to his son, who had been in Venice since September:<br><br>I have another loss to announce ... Mr Turner - I can say no more till I go to Norwood and see Griffith who kindly sent me a note this forenoon during Church ... a suitable day for the intelligence - the shortest and darkest - wet &amp; tempestuous ... I thank you for ... a liking for the Red Rigi for the solemnity of that picture has fed &amp; soothed me like a dead march all this evening. It is the only picture I care for tonight - I earnestly hope you will not let this hurt your health - There is no power gone exactly with his Life for his power had already departed - &amp; you seemed to be prepared for this event.<br><br>Once unburdened of its grave intelligence, John James's letter revealed another reaction to news of Turner's death - a commercial one. He had recently put aside �650 for the purpose of enlarging his collection of Turner's work further. Now John James was regretting letting Carisbrooke Castle go. But he realized that with the artist's death a huge amount of new work would most likely come on to the market with the sale of his estate. It would be an opportunity that the Ruskins must be prepared for.<br><br>'I do not think you need distract your arrangements to acquire any remains,' he suggested. 'There is little chance of Executors bringing anything to sale till ... May or June - but please tell me all you want. There will be excitement &amp; high prices as in Wilkie's case in the period of his Death which will afterwards give way.'<br><br>Over the next few days Ruskin continued to ponder the market ramifications of Turner's death, news of which had not yet broken in the press. Despite the imminence of Christmas, he was impatient to find out more about the disposal of Turner's estate.<br><br>On 22 December he wrote to his son again, this time explaining: 'Mr Griffith ... has gone to a meeting of Executors ... No one at present knows where he died but they promise to let us know particularly and there will be plenty of time for you to say what you wish.'<br><br>Harpur and Hardwick, meanwhile, had been busy making sure that despite the increasing curiosity as to the place of Turner's departure from mortal life, no one would find out. They had been swift in removing Turner's body from Chelsea and installing it where Turner should have died, in his professional premises at Queen Anne Street. A lavish hearse had arrived in Davis Place along with a large, expensive and heavy coffin, lined with lead and satin. Bemused locals watched as the undertakers, more used to the spacious homes of wealthy clients, could barely get the coffin through the door, and when it failed to go up the narrow stairs, the men were forced to bring the body down to it.</p><h2>A History of US: Sourcebook and Index: A History of US Book Eleven (A History of US, 11)</h2><p><strong>Recommended by the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy as an exemplary informational text.</strong><br><br>Designed to accompany Joy Hakim's ten volume A History of US or as a stand alone reference, this collection of great American documents is ideal for all students of American history.

Here the focus is on the development of measure and integration theory, differentiation and integration, Hilbert spaces, and Hausdorff measure and fractals. This book reflects the objective of the series as a whole: to make plain the organic unity that exists between the various parts of the subject, and to illustrate the wide applicability of ideas of analysis to other fields of mathematics and science.</p><br><p> After setting forth the basic facts of measure theory, Lebesgue integration, and differentiation on Euclidian spaces, the authors move to the elements of Hilbert space, via the L2 theory. They next present basic illustrations of these concepts from Fourier analysis, partial differential equations, and complex analysis. The final part of the book introduces the reader to the fascinating subject of fractional-dimensional sets, including Hausdorff measure, self-replicating sets, space-filling curves, and Besicovitch sets. Each chapter has a series of exercises, from the relatively easy to the more complex, that are tied directly to the text. A substantial number of hints encourage the reader to take on even the more challenging exercises.</p><br><p> As with the other volumes in the series, <i>Real Analysis</i> is accessible to students interested in such diverse disciplines as mathematics, physics, engineering, and finance, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.</p><br><p> Also available, the first two volumes in the Princeton Lectures in Analysis:</p></p><p><b>Elias M.

What more was there to say? "Gross global brain damage with severe mental retardation." The summary words of Dr. Wilmington's diagnosis rang through my ears like a death knell for Melanie. I was devastated and disbelieving. They could not be right, for her intelligence communicated itself to me at every turn. They could not be right because she had learned too quickly all the things I had tried to teach her. They could not be right because her eyes told me they were wrong. They could not, please God, be right because if they were, she would live a life so limited as to be almost useless. They could not be right because she was <i>my child!</i><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How does a mother tread the fine line between what she sees and what she wants to see in her child? Where are the strengths and where are the weaknesses of the objective view of the outsider, as compared with the subjective view of the mother? <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I believe that the mother's advantage is that of intimacy, which allows her a depth of perception unavailable to an outsider. I knew, for example, that Melanie's difficulty in focusing her eyes often made her appear to be turning away from people when she was in fact trying to look at them. With the advantage of intimacy, I knew also that the little squeal that others might interpret as a cry was Melanie's version of a laugh. I knew that flared nostrils followed by a little yawn meant that she was emptying her bladder. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But the mother's intimacy may also be a disadvantage. That intimacy made it impossible for me to see Melanie for the first time&#x2014; to see her in her totality as a functioning individual who exists in the present and who compares in any given way to other individuals. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Such intimate knowledge of my child, and in this I am no different from other mothers, made it difficult for me to see her objectively at any point in time. How easy it is for a stranger to say of a child, "This child is spoilt and throws tantrums," "This child is cooperative," "This child is bright," "This child is retarded." Easy because a stranger meets the child on a given occasion and forms an overall impression&#x2014;an impression that may be valid but is one dimensional.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The mother, knowing every stage that has contributed to the present entity, sees at once the present, past, and hopeful future and, in genuine confusion, replies, "Ah! Do you think so? Well, but, you see . . . ." Like the seasoned hunter, she cannot see the forest for the trees; she knows by touch each contour of the land but has no aerial view. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To me, it did not matter that from an aerial view the parts of Melanie's personal jigsaw puzzle did not integrate to form an impressive overall picture. What I knew was each part, by detail of color, shape, and texture. What the objective observers seemed to be looking for was the overall impression&#x2014;the gestalt presented by Melanie's ill-fitting and poorly coordinated parts. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They observed, for example, that her comprehension of language appeared to be way ahead of all other areas of her development. Indeed, they made a point of commenting on this incongruity between her receptive language and her overall functioning. But they simply could not accept that such a mismatch could be true and attributed her comprehension to intensive repetitive drill on my part and consequent rote learning by Melanie. By <i>rote learning</i>, they meant learning that can only be applied within the narrow limits in which the lesson took place. In rote learning, there is no ability to transfer knowledge or apply it in new situations because it is learning that is mechanical rather than creative in nature, and is largely limited to the context in which it was first acquired. According to this view, Melanie's comprehension of language was, in the psychologist's words, a not very meaningful "splinter development." <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What effect did this devastating judgment by these professionals have upon me and my view of Melanie? <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wish I could say that their words were only barely influential, that I knew I could retain my own opinion in spite of theirs. But I cannot. In spite of my own experience and observations, I was vastly influenced and depressed by these pronouncements. I think, in the long run, after my initial shock and astonishment, I gradually worked my way to a feeling something like this: I was not convinced that they were right that Melanie had so little potential for intellectual development. But I decided to face the fact that obviously she <i>functioned</i> as someone with severe disabilities regardless of what potential she might possess; and after all, how can one consider or describe potential in isolation from a person's performance? The fact was she performed at the level of a person with severe developmental disabilities. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But the corollary to this of course would be, what then? Should I alter my expectations and thus, probably, my efforts and objectives to be more in tune with this terrible diagnosis? I believe that I could not help altering my expectations to some extent. I pride myself on being a realist who manages to cope reasonably well with crises because I take care to prepare myself by accepting whatever appears to be factual. I think I have considerable faith in my own judgment under normal circumstances, but I also have great respect for experience and training. It would have been very difficult for me to maintain my optimism without some encouragement from professional quarters. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fortunately, I did receive <i>some</i> encouragement. Sarah, Melanie's most admiring therapist, was convinced that her colleagues were wrong. She insisted, with no reservations, that Melanie behaved like an intelligent child severely affected by athetoid cerebral palsy, affecting all her muscular coordination including facial expression and speech. She lectured me severely on allowing myself to be influenced in my approach and insisted that I must aim as high as possible for Melanie and at all times expect comprehension. She reminded me of Dr. Karen Pape's explanation of how difficult it would be for whatever intelligence Melanie might have to break through the barriers of severe brain stem and cerebellar damage, and we regretted that Dr. Pape was away in England at that time. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like Dr. Challenor and my friend Pat at Blythedale Hospital the year before, Sarah recommended Bobath physical therapy as the most important treatment for Melanie, an approach in which a child is repeatedly put through all the normal developmental patterns of movement in the correct sequence in an attempt to diminish the abnormal reflexes of the child with cerebral palsy and to teach the child to exercise conscious control over her muscles. I doubted very much that I would find such a therapist in Trinidad but was determined to continue practicing what principles I had already learned from the OCCC staff and from Sarah. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have said that I was depressed and discouraged by the assessment that June. Yet I knew that I could never choose to do less than my best for Melanie. Her welfare and development had become the object of my life, and my own satisfaction and sense of personal well-being were now inextricably bound to hers. If I could work successfully with her, accepting her limitations but providing every possible opportunity for her development, then I would be successful in my own eyes and could live happily with myself and with her. </p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Ten Traits of Highly Effective Principals: From Good to Great Performance</h2><p><p>Increase your own effectiveness with the help of the built-in facilitator&#x2032;s guide, ideas, reflections, behaviors, habits, and inspiring stories.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Highly effective principals have strong communication skills, high levels of knowledge about teaching and learning, and the abililty to provide instructional leadership.

The Seventh Edition reflects several developments within the field of behavior modification, without diminishing an essential emphasis on applied research and intervention techniques. Kazdin has expanded and refined discussions of functional behavioral assessment, antecedent events and their influence on behavior, assessment options, ensuring the quality of assessment, data evaluation, and ethical and legal issues. New to this edition is an Appendix to guide a behavior-change project that focuses on applying the content of the book in everyday life. In addition to comprehensive coverage and lucid explanations of how assessment, evaluation, and intervention work together to improve the care of individuals, the text contains many learning-oriented features, such as chapter outlines that convey content, direction, and key points; practical examples of principles and techniques; an abundant number of tables that summarize important concepts; exercises for designing or evaluating a specific intervention or for changing a program that is not working; and a list of key terms at the end of the chapters. By completing the exercises and understanding the terms, students can master the core content of the chapters. This outstanding text enables students and professionals with varied interests to implement effective techniques with individuals and in contexts where behavior change is desperately needed in a world challenged by a wide range of social problems.

When he began to work on this neglected field, the few who studied these texts were either amateurs who were looking for occult wisdom, or old-style Kabbalists who were seeking guidance on their spiritual journeys. His work broke with the outlook of the scholars of the previous century in Judaica&#x2014;die Wissenschaft des Judentums, the Science of Judaism&#x2014;whose orientation he rejected, calling their &#x201c;disregard for the most vital aspects of the Jewish people as a collective entity: a form of &#x201c;censorship of the Jewish past.&#x201d; The major founders of modern Jewish historical studies in the nineteenth century, Leopold Zunz and Abraham Geiger, had ignored the Kabbalah; it did not fit into their account of the Jewish religion as rational and worthy of respect by &#x201c;enlightened&#x201d; minds. The only exception was the historian Heinrich Graetz. He had paid substantial attention to its texts and to their most explosive exponent, the false Messiah Sabbatai Zevi, but Graetz had depicted the Kabbalah and all that flowed from it as an unworthy revolt from the underground of Jewish life against its reasonable, law-abiding, and learned mainstream. Scholem conducted a continuing polemic with Zunz, Geiger, and Graetz by bringing into view a Jewish past more varied, more vital, and more interesting than any idealized portrait could reveal.<br>&#x2014;<i>from the Foreword by Arthur Hertzberg, 1995</i></p><p>Gershom Scholem was a professor of Jewish mysticism at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem until his death in 1982. Among his most important works are <i>Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, The Messianic Idea in Judaism,</i> <i>On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism, On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead,</i> and editor of <i>Zohar, the Book of Splendor: Basic Readings from the Kabbalah.</i>"These major essays of historical synthesis provide a probing and challenging overview of Jewish history still pertinent to contemporary concerns."<br>&#x2014;Robert Alter<br><br>&#x201c;Gershom Scholem earned international renown as a brilliant interpreter of esoteric religious texts as well as a trenchant contributor to many of the central intellectual debates of his day. At a time when apocalyptic impulses are intensifying with the approach of a millennial moment in the Christian calendar, we can only welcome Scholem&#x2019;s soberly presented and scrupulously researched account of their Jewish counterparts.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Martin Jay, University of California, Berkeley<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Having had the privilege of knowing Gershom Scholem and having learned much from him, I am delighted to see this collection made available once more. I am especially fond of the essay on &#x201c;Revelation and Tradition,&#x201d; which is vintage Scholem&#x2014;learned, sharp, witty, and adorned with delightful anecdotes from the Talmud. In juxtaposition with the essay that follows, on <i>Wissenschaft des Judentums, </i>it documents the subtle relationship between rational and nonrational elements in the Jewish tradition, the very relationship that Scholem both described so incisively and embodied so vividly.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Jaroslav Pelikan, Yale University</p><h2>Sherlock Holmes: Gods of War</h2><p>1913.

Scrooge aside, there&#x2019;s plenty of fun to be had in this volume. In &#x201c;Volcano Valley&#x201d; Donald and the Nephews end up stuck in Volcania, a south-of-the-border country inhabited by sombrero-wearing, siesta-addicted Volcanians. Other long-form adventures include the self-explanatory &#x201c;Adventure Down Under,&#x201d; as well as one of Barks&#x2019;s most atmospheric thrillers, the West Indies-based &#x201c;Ghost of the Grotto,&#x201d; which includes a lovely night-time sequence drawn in Barks&#x2019;s trademark silhouettes and a giantoctopus- vs.-hot-chili-peppers throwdown that climaxes in an explosive splash panel. The book is rounded off with seven of Barks&#x2019;s hilarious 10-pagers, and as with the previous volumes, <em>Walt Disney&#x2019;s Donald Duck: Christmas on Bear Mountain</em> has been scanned from crisp vintage art and meticulously colored to match the original printing&#x2019;s warm, simple hues, and features abundant critical and historical notes penned by some of duckdom&#x2019;s finest experts.

He lives in Seattle.</p>From the 1940s through the &#x2019;60s, Barks wrote and drew hundreds of comics featuring Donald Duck and his relatives, but he toiled in anonymity (the only name the stories bore was that of impresario Walt Disney). In recent decades, however, he has come to be recognized as one of the masters of the comics medium. This volume in the ambitious project collecting Barks&#x2019; entire Duck Family oeuvre introduces Donald&#x2019;s skinflint uncle, Scrooge McDuck, who would go on to become the most enduring of the original characters Barks created to expand into the world of the animated cartoons. Other stories depict Donald&#x2019;s squabbles with his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie; his doomed get-rich-quick schemes; and his globetrotting adventures in foreign lands. These tales from 1947 exemplify Barks&#x2019; strengths: vivid yet precise cartooning; brilliant comedic dialogue and timing; and incisive characterizations (of ducks, no less). The pristine, full-color restoration of the vintage pages and the insightful historical notes do justice to these timeless tales, which remain as enthralling and delightful today as when they first appeared, nearly seven decades ago. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>Unplug the Christmas Machine: A Complete Guide to Putting Love and Joy Back into the Season</h2><p><p>Nine years and thirteen printings later, <em>Unplug the Christmas Machine</em> is still the undisputed guide to creating a joyful, stress-free holiday season.

Their trip, and a second shortly thereafter, would have historic consequences.</p><p></p><p>Inside the car, which was his, Eugene Wigner, wispy-voiced and as unprepossessing as a small-town pharmacist, listened patiently to the intense, curly-haired Leo Szilard. Wigner always let his friend, whom he called "The General," think he was in charge, but Wigner's piercing eyes, hidden behind steel-rimmed glasses, missed nothing. As they drove, they argued in their native tongue, Hungarian, about what they would say to the great man.</p><p></p><p>Deep in a typically heated conversation, the two Hungarians got lost. For two hours they drove around the South Shore; Einstein's retreat, however, was in Peconic, on the North. Finally, they found Peconic, but the roads and gray shingle houses all looked identical to the pudgy Szilard, sweaty in his gray wool suit. Agitated, he began to think that fate might be against their bold step. The cooler Wigner calmed him down. "Let's just ask somebody where Einstein lives," he suggested. "Everybody knows who Einstein is." Finally, a boy of about seven pointed his fishing rod toward a one-story house with a screened front porch.</p><p></p><p>The sixty-year-old Einstein welcomed his visitors, old friends from Berlin days, wearing a white undershirt and rolled-up trousers. He had spent the morning sailing. Szilard and Wigner now switched to German and went straight to the point; they were in no mood for small talk. Einstein was aware of recent experiments in Germany suggesting that if neutrons bombarded uranium a nuclear chain reaction could be created. But the second part of the Hungarians' message was news to Einstein: that a nuclear chain reaction could lead to incredibly powerful bombs -- atomic bombs! Shaking his famous white mane, Einstein said, "Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht" -- I had not thought of that at all. But Einstein's former colleagues at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, Szilard warned, appeared to be closing in on the discovery. Until that moment, Einstein, the man whose theories had launched the revolution in physics, had not believed that atomic energy would be liberated "in my lifetime." Now he saw how his famous equation of 1905, E=mc2, might apply to the explosive release of energy from mass, using uranium bombs.</p><p></p><p>Though a pacifist, Einstein well understood the Nazi threat; like Szilard and Wigner, he had left Germany because of Adolf Hitler. So the father of relativity signed a letter, prepared primarily by Szilard, to the Belgian ambassador in Washington, warning the Belgian government that bombs of unimaginable power could be made out of uranium, whose primary source was the Belgian Congo. Then Einstein returned to his dinghy, and the two Hungarians drove back to the city.</p><p></p><p>Szilard worried that this would not be enough: should they not also alert President Franklin Delano Roosevelt? "We did not know our way around in America," Szilard later recalled. But he knew an investment banker named Alexander Sachs, a friend of the president who did know Washington. After Szilard talked to Sachs, the banker concurred: the president must be told.</p><p></p><p>So two weeks later, on Sunday, July 30, Szilard returned to Einstein's cottage. Wigner was in California, so Szilard -- who did not know how to drive -- turned to another Hungarian, who owned a 1935 Plymouth: a young physics professor at Columbia University named Edward Teller. (Teller would later joke that he entered history as Leo Szilard's chauffeur.) Together Szilard and his bushy-browed driver extracted a second letter from Einstein. It was probably the most important letter of the twentieth century.</p><p></p><p>"I believe," the greatest scientist of the century wrote to the most important political leader of the age, "it is my duty to bring to your attention...that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future. This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable -- though much less certain -- that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory.</p><p></p><p>"The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the former Czechoslovakia, while the most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo.</p><p></p><p>"In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America." (Emphasis added.)</p><p></p><p>Szilard believed that such a letter, signed by none other than Albert Einstein, would get immediate attention. But it did not. On September 1, 1939, when Hitler attacked Poland, Einstein's letter lay unread somewhere in FDR's in-box.</p><p></p><p>Einstein's letter was finally brought directly to FDR's attention by Sachs on October 11, and began the process that would lead to the creation of the Manhattan Project -- the top secret government effort to build the atom bomb. But Roosevelt had no idea that the letter was the work of three Hungarian refugees who were not yet American citizens.</p><p></p><p>It was altogether fitting that these products of Budapest's Golden Age would stimulate the most momentous scientific-military enterprise of the twentieth century, leading to the Manhattan Project, and, after that, Hiroshima. Szilard, Wigner, and Teller -- these men were just part of a group of Hungarians who, after fleeing fascist Budapest in the 1920s and 1930s, brought their distinctive outlook on life, science, and culture to the United States and Western Europe -- and played immensely important roles in shaping the mid-twentieth-century world. Forced into exile by the rising tide of fascism, they would alter the way we fight and prevent wars, help shape those most modern art forms, photography and the movies, and transform the music we listen to.</p><p></p><p>This is the tale of some of them -- specifically, four scientists, two photographers, two film directors, and a writer -- who, collectively, helped usher in the nuclear age and the age of the computer, who left us some of our most beloved movies and many of the most enduring images of the violent century they navigated. The currents of twentieth-century history, science, culture, and politics entered them as young men in Budapest, and as they crossed borders and oceans in search of safety, they carried with them only their genius and ideas -- truly they had magic in their pockets.</p><p></p><p>Who were these men, and where did they come from? Was it simply a coincidence that they were from such a strange little country, with a language incomprehensible to the rest of the world? Or was there something peculiar about that country and that city at that time that created, in so many different fields, so many unusual people?</p><p></p><p>Leo Szilard, Edward Teller, and Eugene Wigner -- along with another genius from Budapest, John von Neumann -- brought to America more than the physics revolution. Having saved themselves from Hitler, they were determined to alert their new nation to the mounting danger. Buffeted by every political upheaval of the century, the four scientists, and the others in this narrative, were in the vanguard of an early warning system. Working in vastly different fields, they tried to rouse a world still averting its gaze from the gathering storm. As the scientists pushed for the atom bomb, Arthur Koestler was writing Darkness at Noon, the first real expos� of Stalinist brutality to achieve worldwide fame. Michael Curtiz was making Casablanca, as much a call to anti-fascist arms as it is a romance. Robert Capa was making an immortal photographic record of the helpless victims of Generalissimo Francisco Franco's indiscriminate aerial bombs, photographs to stand alongside Pablo Picasso's Guernica in the field of art as political statement.</p><p></p><p>This is the chronicle of the remarkable journey of nine men from Budapest to the New World, how they strove and what they learned along the way, and the imprint they made on America and the world.</p><p></p><p>Some of the nine -- Robert Capa and Edward Teller -- are famous, others less so, but of equal consequence. John von Neumann, widely believed by his contemporaries to be the smartest of them all, pioneered the electronic computer and invented Game Theory. Andre Kertesz, along with Capa and Henri Cartier-Bresson, virtually invented modern photojournalism. The names of Michael Curtiz and Alexander Korda may be less well known today, but their work is immortal. Curtiz's Casablanca is the most popular romantic film of all time. Korda, whose life story is more fanciful than any Hollywood fabrication, also left enduring movies; in 1994 the New York Times called Korda's The Third Man "one of the finest films ever made," a widely held judgment. Arthur Koestler is on every list of the twentieth century's greatest political writers.</p><p></p><p>They had in common, first of all, a time and a place. They were members of the same generation, roughly spanning the last decade of the nineteenth century until the outbreak of World War I. All they would become started in the city of their birth, Budapest. They were by no means unique in Budapest in its brief Golden Age; gifted men, and transforming figures, but these nine were but the tip of an iceberg of talent that came out of Budapest. Over a dozen Nobel Prize winners emerged from roughly the same generation of ...</p></p><h2>Shamans and Kushtakas: North Coast Tales of the Supernatural</h2><p><p>Shaman and Kushtaka, both struck terror in the hearts of the Tlingit and Haida, for both possessed frightening supernatural powers. Among the Natives of the Pacific Northwest Coast, the shaman was honored as a person who could heal the body and spirit as well as see into the future. In his struggles to protect his people, he fought the kushtaka&#x2015;an evil spirit-being who was half human and half land hotter&#x2015;for the souls of dying persons. Theirs was a battle between the forces of good and evil, and today it remains a cornerstone in Tlingit and Haida mythology. Mary Giraudo Beck provides a powerful mix of history, legend, and adventure to dramatize the values and traditions of Tlingit and Haida societies. The heroic and wondrous incidents in these stories transcend time and culture and, as tales of myth and magic, provide compelling reading for young and old alike.</p></p><p>&#x201c;The stories in this work have been repeated to me by various Tlingit and Haida friends and students over the more than forty years I lived in Ketchikan. Often the tellers related only parts of the stories, or the same stories would be repeated with varying details and outcomes. Therefore, as a guide to retelling the basic story, I made use of several written sources, at the same time weaving in details or outcomes from oral sources.&#x201d; ---From Acknowledgements, Mary G.

It includes The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas in its entirety; selected passages from The Making of Americans; &#34;Melanctha&#34;from Three Lives; portraits of the painters Cezanne, Matisse, and Picasso; Tender Buttons; the opera Four Saints in Three Acts; and poem, plays, lectures, articles, sketches, and a generous portion of her famous book on the Occupation of France, Wars I Have Seen.</p><p><b>Gertrude Stein</b>&nbsp;was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, on February 3, 1874. At Radcliffe College she studied under William James, who remained her lifelong friend, and then went to Johns Hopkins to study medicine. Abandoning her studies, she moved to Paris with her brother Leo in 1903. At 27 rue de Fleurus, Gertrude Stein lived with Alice B. Toklas, who would remain her companion for 40 years. Not only was she an innovator in literature and a supporter of modern poetry and art, she was the friend and mentor of those who visited her at her now-famous home: Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Jean Cocteau, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sherwood Anderson, and Guillaume Apollinaire.

This famous study explores the guilt that arises when personal desires clash with social norms, and it examines attempts to reconcile the conflict.<br>In a sense, such guilt is among civilization's building blocks, keeping aggressive and selfish instincts within bounds. But it can also be a source of great frustration, and Freud examines at length many ways of dealing with guilt, from artistic and scientific pursuits to abuse of drink and drugs. The great psychologist offers revealing insights into the motivation behind human behavior as well as the evolution of many social institutions. This seminal study reveals the struggles to resolve conflicts and cast off guilt as spurs to the growth of civilization and culture.</p><p>4 1-hour cassettes<p>The Father of Psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud (1856&#x2013;1939)&nbsp;ranks among the most important figures in Western psychology. He is responsible for the theories of parapraxis (Freudian slips), dreams as wish fulfillment, the Oedipus complex, repression, the unconscious mind, and other concepts.</p></p><h2>Rescuing the Gospel: The Story and Significance of the Reformation</h2><p><b>The Riveting Story of the Reformation and Its Significance Today<br></b><br>The Reformation unfolded in the cathedrals and town squares of Europe--in Wittenberg, Worms, Rome, Geneva, and Zurich--and it is a stirring story of courage and cowardice, of betrayal and faith. <br><br>The story begins with the Catholic Church and its desperate need for reform. The dramatic events that followed are traced from John Wycliffe in England, to the burning of John Hus at the stake in Prague, to the rampant sale of indulgences in the cities and towns of Germany, to Martin Luther nailing the <i>Ninety-Five Theses</i> to the door of the Castle Church in 1517, to John Calvin's reform of Geneva. <br><br>Erwin Lutzer captures the people, places, and big ideas that fueled the Reformation and explains its lasting influence on the church and Western Civilization.</p><p><b>A stirring story of courage and cowardice, betrayal and faith<br></b><br>"The gospel that Jesus and the apostles proclaimed in the first century is the gospel that Martin Luther and the Reformers proclaimed in the sixteenth century, and it is the same gospel we must proclaim today. With pastoral wisdom and passion, Dr.&nbsp;Lutzer explores the remarkable story of the Reformation, and he powerfully demonstrates why the story of the Reformation is, in fact, our story.

He is the featured speaker on three radio programs, including <i>Running to Win</i>. Lutzer and his wife, Rebecca, live in the Chicago area.<b>A riveting account of the Reformation--and why it matters today<br></b><br>The Reformation unfolded in the cathedrals and town squares of Europe--in Wittenberg, Worms, Rome, Geneva, and Zurich. The story begins with the Catholic Church and its desperate need for reform. The dramatic events that followed are traced from John Wycliffe in England, to the burning of John Hus at the stake at the Council of Constance, to the rampant sale of indulgences in the cities and towns of Germany, to Martin Luther nailing the <i>Ninety-Five Theses</i> to the door of the Castle Church in 1517, to John Calvin's reform of Geneva. <br><br>In prose that captivates as it informs, Erwin W. Lutzer captures the people, places, and big ideas that fueled the Reformation. He explains its lasting influence on the church and Western civilization. And, perhaps most importantly, he shows why the actions of passionate believers five hundred years ago still matter today.<br>"At the Reformation's five hundredth anniversary, Erwin Lutzer reminds us not only why the Reformation is one of the most significant events in Western history but also why it still holds important lessons for the church today. As Lutzer demonstrates in this book, the theological convictions of Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin need to be recovered as an antidote to the watered-down gospel proclaimed from many Protestant pulpits in our day. Every Protestant needs to recognize the incredible theological debt we owe to the Reformers. Let this book introduce you to their lives, their ministries, and, most importantly, their theology."--<b>R. Albert Mohler Jr.</b>, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><h2>Undoing Monogamy: The Politics of Science and the Possibilities of Biology</h2><p>In <i>Undoing Monogamy</i> Angela Willey offers a radically interdisciplinary exploration of the concept of monogamy in U.S. science and culture, propelled by queer feminist desires for new modes of conceptualization and new forms of belonging. She approaches the politics and materiality of monogamy as intertwined with one another such that disciplinary ways of knowing themselves become an object of critical inquiry. Refusing to answer the naturalization of monogamy with a naturalization of nonmonogamy, Willey demands a critical reorientation toward the monogamy question in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. The book examines colonial sexual science, monogamous voles, polyamory, and the work of Alison Bechdel and Audre Lorde to show how challenging the lens through which human nature is seen as monogamous or nonmonogamous forces us to reconsider our investments in coupling and in disciplinary notions of biological bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Angela Willey is Assistant Professor of Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst."<i>Undoing Monogamy</i> is an important contribution to feminist and queer studies of science, to feminist materialisms, and to academic studies of non/monogamy.... <i>Undoing Monogamy</i> provides us with an example of how to approach science differently in ways that are grounded more in the lives and needs of a wider variety of diverse humans and nonhumans." (Kim TallBear <i>Hypatia</i> 2016-04-01)<br><br>"The value of Undoing Monogamy to scholars of non/monogamy is unquestionable. The careful, historical attention to the way that non/monogamy has been implicated in colonial logics and ongoing projects of racism is a vital contribution to the field."

(Kyla Tompkins <i>American Quarterly</i> 2018-01-12)<br><br>"<i>Undoing Monogamy</i> makes a key theoretical intervention: clarifying ow new materialist approaches can build on, rather than depart from (or at worst, ignore), the insights of feminist science studies.

Like everything else about the book group, this date and the time&#x2014;3:30 in the afternoon&#x2014;had been carefully chosen after months of planning. The first Sunday in January seemed ideal because, as the school vacation had just ended, families would be home and the children would be refreshed. We chose late afternoon to minimize potential conflicts with the other myriad activities in which Connecticut second graders participate. We knew, for example, that the basketball league held its games on Saturday, ice-skating lessons were Sunday morning, the Sunday dance rehearsals for the Nutcracker were over, and soccer practice wouldn&#x2019;t resume until early April.<br><br>It turned out, however, that we hadn&#x2019;t thought of everything. The hapless New York Jets, a team that had not made the NFL play-offs in eight seasons or finished with a good enough record to host a play-off game in two decades, had that year miraculously achieved both. The young and hungry Jacksonville Jaguars were coming to town on, when else, January 10, and the winner would then meet the Denver Broncos for the right to go on to the Super Bowl.<br><br>Interest in the game approached the fanatical. The Meadowlands drew the second-largest crowd in the history of the stadium. (The largest had been for the pope.) Kick off was set for one p.m., which put the start of our little book group somewhere in the middle of the fourth quarter, when every living creature in the New York metropolitan area would be frozen in front of a television set.<br><br>At the last minute, however, it appeared that the fates might yet be with us. The game had descended into a rout and the Jets held a 31&#x2013;14 lead at the beginning of the fourth quarter. By the time we piled into the car to head for the children&#x2019;s department of the library with our books, markers, large writing pad, and enough cookies and juice to ensure the loyalty of our audience, we had brightened substantially. &#x201c;No one needs to stay and see the end of that,&#x201d; we said.<br><br>But no sooner had we backed out of the driveway&#x2014;with the radio tuned to the game, of course&#x2014;then Jacksonville scored a touchdown. During the five-minute trip to the library, they scored again. Before we could unload the car, the Jets had been intercepted and the potent Jacksonville offense had the ball once more.<br><br>&#x201c;Hang on to your hats,&#x201d; trumpeted the announcer. &#x201c;This is gonna be a wild finish.&#x201d;<br><br>With indefatigable if slightly forced good cheer, we trudged in and dragged our paraphernalia up the stairs to the meeting room. We set up an easel for the pad at the front of the room, laid out the snacks, and waited. Ten minutes later, we were still the only people in the room.<br><br>Finally, the door opened and a librarian stuck her head in. &#x201c;Someone named Katherine&#x2019;s mother called to say that they can&#x2019;t make it this time but they&#x2019;ll be here next time, and one of the other parents called to say that neither the father nor the son had read the book and did that matter?&#x201d;<br><br>At 3:27, a mother and daughter walked in, looked around at the empty room, and wordlessly sat down. Soon another mother and daughter arrived and then, astoundingly, a father and daughter. They were followed closely by another father and his son. The first father and the second father exchanged a glance, the meaning of which was all too clear. Soon, we had ten second graders, each with a parent, four of whom were distressed fathers. When the last of the fathers entered, he gave the final, damning report.<br><br>&#x201c;Down to a seven-point lead. Still four minutes to go.&#x201d;<br><br>The dads all sunk a little lower in their seats, then, as one, turned to face us. We could read &#x201c;This had better be worth it&#x201d; written plainly on each of their faces. As they say in comedy . . . a tough room.<br><br>And so we launched into the afternoon&#x2019;s offering: Mr. Popper&#x2019;s Penguins.<br>Mr. Popper&#x2019;s Penguins is about a housepainter who lives in a small town called Stillwater. Mr. Popper lives with Mrs. Popper and two little Poppers. He does not make a lot of money, possibly because he is so busy daydreaming about traveling to the Antarctic (a big deal in 1938 when this book was written). He couldn&#x2019;t work in the winter, so he spent his time reading about explorers. As the story opens, he has just sent a letter to Admiral Drake, a famous Antarctic explorer, extolling the virtues of penguins. Admiral Drake responds by sending Mr. Popper a penguin of his very own.<br><br>Lots of humorous mishaps occur and a female penguin arrives, which quickly gives rise to ten additional penguins. Mr. Popper, in an attempt to afford all these penguins, takes them on the road as a stage act. They are wildly successful, earning the Poppers lots of money that they spend entirely on the penguins. Eventually, however, Mr. Popper and the penguins land in jail in New York from which they are rescued by Admiral Drake, who has just returned from his expedition. So impressed is Admiral Drake with Mr. Popper that he takes him on his next voyage. The book closes with an illustration of a smiling Mr. Popper in a fur hood, next to a penguin, looking over the railing of a ship.<br><br>&#x201c;Welcome to the book group! Thank you all for coming,&#x201d; we said, after everyone had gone around the room and introduced themselves and we&#x2019;d made it clear to the kids that we were going to discuss the book for a while before we broke for snacks. &#x201c;Books are like puzzles,&#x201d; we began. &#x201c;The author&#x2019;s ideas are hidden and it is up to all of us to figure them out. Whenever you read a book you want to know what the book is really about, not what it&#x2019;s about on the surface, not the story, but what&#x2019;s underneath the story. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>A little boy&#x2019;s hand went up.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Jeremy? Do you have an idea about what the book is really about?&#x201d;<br><br>Jeremy (we&#x2019;ve obviously changed all the names) was one of those kids you run into from time to time who appears to be actually a miniature adult. He was dressed in an Oxford shirt, V-neck sweater, corduroys, and what appeared to be little Rockport shoes. He stared intensely for a moment.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Popper&#x2019;s Penguins is about a man named Mr. Popper,&#x201d; he reported. &#x201c;Mr. Popper gets a penguin in the mail who he trains. Then he gets another penguin. They have babies. Then they go to New York.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good, Jeremy, but that&#x2019;s the story. We&#x2019;re looking for what the author is trying to say underneath the story. What the story is really about. What do you think the story is really about?&#x201d;<br><br>Jeremy nodded. &#x201c;They get in trouble in New York. They even go to jail. Admiral Drake gets them out. Then Mr. Popper and the penguins go on the boat with Admiral Drake.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Jeremy, that&#x2019;s very good.&#x201d; Oh dear, we thought.<br><br>We tried some different, open-ended questions, like &#x201c;Why do you think the authors chose penguins?&#x201d; but it was proving impossible to move either the kids or the parents off the plot. After about twenty minutes, our worst fears were being realized: blank stares from the kids, restlessness from the parents, long silences, and two heavily perspiring moderators.<br><br>We continued to flounder until we asked, &#x201c;The town that Mr. Popper lived in . . . what kind of a place was it? Why do you think the authors chose the name Stillwater? Was it just an accident?&#x201d;<br><br>This had more success. One little girl said that she didn&#x2019;t think it was an accident and we quickly (and gratefully) moved into a discussion of Stillwater. Everyone in the town except Mr. Popper, the kids quickly noticed, was &#x201c;dull.&#x201d; They were &#x201c;boring,&#x201d; &#x201c;ordinary,&#x201d; and &#x201c;did what everyone else did.&#x201d; &#x201c;What do you think about people like that?&#x201d; we asked. &#x201c;How would you describe them in one word?&#x201d;<br><br>Rebecca, a girl in the back, waved her hand furiously. &#x201c;NORMAL,&#x201d; she replied with triumph. The parents chuckled but shifted uneasily in their seats.<br><br>&#x201c;What about Mr. Popper?&#x201d; we went on. He was certainly not normal, the kids agreed. He was . . . they couldn&#x2019;t seem to find the right word. So, on the easel, we wrote:<br><br>D _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _<br><br>A mother raised her hand. &#x201c;Demented?&#x201d; she offered.<br><br>&#x201c;Nooooo.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dumb?&#x201d; suggested one of the little boys, obviously not a spelling whiz.<br><br>&#x201c;Noooo.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about &#x2018;different&#x2019;?&#x201d; asked another mother.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes! And what made him different?&#x201d;<br><br>After a little more discussion it came out. Mr. Popper was different because he had a dream, and he was the only one in the town who did. What&#x2019;s more, he had done something about it. He had followed his dream.<br><br>&#x201c;Could this be a book about the importance of following your dreams?&#x201d; we asked. &#x201c;Was that what the book was really about?&#x201d;<br><br>There was a slow nodding of heads.<br><br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; we went on, &#x201c;what did everyone think of this? Was it good to follow your dreams, or even to keep them?&#x201d; The expression on each parent&#x2019;s face changed. We went around the room, first asking each child, then each parent, &#x201c;What is your dream?&#x201d;<br><br>The kids, of course, had no trouble with this question. Although a couple had the very suburban dream of making a million dollars, there were also dreams of travel, adventure, and even world peace. When we came to Annabeth, a thoroughly adorable, cherubic little blond girl, she had no problem at all.<br><br>&#x201c;My dream is that my brother gets eaten by a bear,&#x201d; she said happily.</p><h2>The Dreaming Vol. 1: Pathways and Emanations (The Sandman Universe)</h2><p><b>Beyond the wall of sleep, past the Gates of Horn and Ivory, lies the rich and fertile land where stories are born.

The case study at the center of <i>Direct Action</i> is the organizing and events that led to the one of the most dramatic and militant mass protests in recent years against the Summit of the Americas in Qu�bec City. Written in a clear, accessible style (with a minimum of academic jargon), this study brings readers behind the scenes of a movement that has changed the terms of debate about world power relations. From informal conversations in coffee shops to large spokescouncil&#x201d; planning meetings and tear gas-drenched street actions, Graeber paints a vivid and fascinating picture.</p><p>Along the way, he addresses matters of deep interest to anthropologists: meeting structure and process, language, symbolism and representation, the specific rituals of activist culture, and much more. Starting from the assumption that, when dealing with possibilities of global transformation and emerging political forms, a disinterested, objective&#x201d; perspective is impossible, Graeber writes as both scholar and activist. At the same time, his experiment in the application of ethnographic methods to important ongoing political events is a serious and unique contribution to the field of anthropology, as well as an inquiry into anthropology&#x2019;s political implications.</p><p><b>David Graeber</b> is an anthropologist and activist who teaches at the University of London.

You're wrapping up the operation when someone blunders onto the season's big score.</p><p>OK. I'm exaggerating. But it's damn close to what happened. And the final outcome was far more disturbing than any last-minute discovery of a potsherd or hearth. </p><p>It was May 18, the second-to-the-last day of the archaeological field school. I had twenty students digging a site on Dewees, a barrier island north of Charleston, South Carolina.</p><p>I also had a journalist. With the IQ of plankton. </p><p>"Sixteen bodies?" Plankton pulled a spiral notebook as his brain strobed visions of Dahmer and Bundy. "Vics ID'd?" </p><p>"The graves are prehistoric."</p><p>Two eyes rolled up, narrowed under puffy lids. "Old Indians?" </p><p>"Native Americans." </p><p>"They got me covering dead Indians?" No political correctness prize for this guy.</p><p>"They?" Icy.</p><p>"The Moultrie News. The East Cooper community paper." </p><p>Charleston, as Rhett told Scarlett, is a city marked by the genial grace of days gone by. Its heart is the Peninsula, a district of antebellum homes, cobbled streets, and outdoor markets bounded by the Ashley and Cooper rivers. Charlestonians define their turf by these waterways. Neighborhoods are referred to as "West Ashley" or "East Cooper," the latter including Mount Pleasant, and three islands, Sullivan's, the Isle of Palms, and Dewees. I assumed plankton's paper covered that beat.</p><p>"And you are?" I asked.</p><p>"Homer Winborne."</p><p>With his five-o'clock shadow and fast food paunch, the guy looked more like Homer Simpson.</p><p>"We're busy here, Mr. Winborne."</p><p>Winborne ignored that. "Isn't it illegal?" </p><p>"We have a permit. The island's being developed, and this little patch is slated for home sites."</p><p>"Why bother?" Sweat soaked Winborne's hairline. When he reached for a hanky, I noticed a tick cruising his collar. </p><p>"I'm an anthropologist on faculty at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. My students and I are here at the request of the state."</p><p>Though the first bit was true, the back end was a stretch. Actually, it happened like this.</p><p>UNCC's New World archaeologist normally conducted a student excavation during the short presummer term each May. In late March of this year, the lady had announced her acceptance of a position at Purdue. Busy sending out r�sum�s throughout the winter, she'd ignored the field school. Sayonara. No instructor. No site.</p><p>Though my specialty is forensics, and I now work with the dead sent to coroners and medical examiners, my graduate training and early professional career were devoted to the not so recently deceased. For my doctoral research I'd examined thousands of prehistoric skeletons recovered from North American burial mounds.</p><p>The field school is one of the Anthropology Department's most popular courses, and, as usual, was enrolled to capacity. My colleague's unexpected departure sent the chair into a panic. He begged that I take over. The students were counting on it! A return to my roots! Two weeks at the beach! Extra pay! I thought he was going to throw in a Buick.</p><p>I'd suggested Dan Jaffer, a bioarchaeologist and my professional counterpart with the medical examiner/coroner system in the great Palmetto State to our south. I pleaded possible cases at the ME office in Charlotte, or at the Laboratoire de sciences judiciaires et de m�decine l�gale in Montreal, the two agencies for which I regularly consult.</p><p>The chair gave it a shot. Good idea, bad timing. Dan Jaffer was on his way to Iraq. </p><p>I'd contacted Jaffer and he'd suggested Dewees as an excavation possibility. A burial ground was slated for destruction, and he'd been trying to forestall the bulldozers until the site's significance could be ascertained. Predictably, the developer was ignoring his requests.</p><p>I'd contacted the Office of the State Archaeologist in Columbia, and on Dan's recommendation they'd accepted my offer to dig some test trenches, thereby greatly displeasing the developer.</p><p>And here I was. With twenty undergraduates. And, on our thirteenth and penultimate day, plankton-brain.</p><p>My patience was fraying like an overused rope.</p><p>"Name?" Winborne might have been asking about grass seed. </p><p>I fought back the urge to walk away. Give him what he wants, I told myself. He'll leave. Or, with luck, die from the heat.</p><p>"Temperance Brennan."</p><p>"Temperance?" Amused.</p><p>"Yes, Homer."</p><p>Winborne shrugged. "Don't hear that name so much."</p><p>"I'm called Tempe." </p><p>"Like the town in Utah."</p><p>"Arizona." </p><p>"Right. What kind of Indians?" </p><p>"Probably Sewee."</p><p>"How'd you know stuff was here?"</p><p>"Through a colleague at USC-Columbia."</p><p>"How'd he know?"</p><p>"He spotted small mounds while doing a survey after the news of an impending development was announced."</p><p>Winborne took a moment to make notes in his spiral. Or maybe he was buying time to come up with his idea of an insightful question. In the distance I could hear student chatter and the clatter of buckets. Overhead, a gull cawed and another answered. </p><p>"Mounds?" No one was going to short-list this guy for a Pulitzer. </p><p>"Following closure of the graves, shells and sand were heaped on top."</p><p>"What's the point in digging them up?"</p><p>That was it. I hit the little cretin with the interview terminator. Jargon. </p><p>"Burial customs aren't well known for aboriginal Southeastern coastal populations, and this site could substantiate or refute ethnohistoric accounts. Many anthropologists believe the Sewee were part of the Cusabo group. According to some sources, Cusabo funerary practices involved defleshing of the corpse, then placement of the bones in bundles or boxes. Others describe the scaffolding of bodies to allow decomposition prior to burial in common graves."</p><p>"Holy crap. That's gross."</p><p>"More so than draining the blood from a corpse and replacing it with chemical preservatives, injecting waxes and perfumes and applying makeup to simulate life, then interring in airtight coffins and vaults to forestall decay?"</p><p>Winborne looked at me as though I'd spoken Sanskrit. "Who does that?"</p><p>"We do."</p><p>"So what are you finding?"</p><p>"Bones." </p><p>"Just bones?" The tick was now crawling up Winborne's neck. Give a heads-up? Screw it. The guy was irritating as hell. </p><p>I launched into my standard cop and coroner spiel. "The skeleton paints a story of an individual. Sex. Age. Height. Ancestry. In certain cases, medical history or manner of death." Pointedly glancing at my watch, I followed with my archaeological shtick. "Ancient bones are a source of information on extinct populations. How people lived, how they died, what they ate, what diseases they suffered -- "</p><p>Winborne's gaze drifted over my shoulder. I turned. </p><p>Topher Burgess was approaching, various forms of organic and inorganic debris pasted to his sunburned torso. Short and plump, with knit cap, wire rims, and muttonchop sideburns, the kid reminded me of an undergraduate Smee. </p><p>"Odd one intruding into three-east."</p><p>I waited, but Topher didn't elaborate. Not surprising. On exams, Topher's essays often consisted of single-sentence answers. Illustrated.</p><p>"Odd?" I coaxed.</p><p>"It's articulated."</p><p>A complete sentence. Gratifying, but not enlightening. I curled my fingers in a "give me more" gesture.</p><p>"We're thinking intrusive." Topher shifted his weight from one bare foot to another. It was a lot to shift.</p><p>"I'll check it out in a minute."</p><p>Topher nodded, turned, and trudged back to the excavation.</p><p>"What's that mean, 'articulated'?" The tick had reached Winborne's ear and appeared to be considering alternate routes.</p><p>"In proper anatomical alignment. It's uncommon with secondary burials, corpses put into the ground after loss of the flesh. The bones are usually jumbled, sometimes in clumps. Occasionally in these communal graves one or two skeletons will be articulated." </p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Could be a lot of reasons. Maybe someone died immediately before closure of a common pit. Maybe the group was moving on, didn't have time to wait out decomposition."</p><p>A full ten seconds of scribbling, during which the tick moved out of sight. </p><p>"Intrusive. What's that mean?" </p><p>"A body was placed in the grave later. Would you like a closer look?"</p><p>"It's what I'm living for." Putting hanky to forehead, Winborne sighed as if he were onstage. </p><p>I crumbled. "There's a tick in your collar." </p><p>Winborne moved faster than it seemed possible for a man of his bulk to move, yanking his collar, doubling over, and batting his neck in one jerk. The tick flew to the sand and righted itself, apparently used to rejection.</p><p>I set off, skirting clusters of sea oats, their tasseled heads motionless in the heavy air. Only May, and already the mercury was hitting ninety. Though I love the Lowcountry, I was glad I wouldn't be digging here into the summer.</p><p>I moved quickly, knowing Winborne wouldn't keep up. Mean? Yes. But time was short. I had none to waste on a dullard reporter.</p><p>And I was conscience-clear on the tick.</p><p>Some student's boom-box pounded out a tune I didn't recognize by a group whose name I didn't know and wouldn't remember if told. I'd have preferred seabirds and surf, though today's selections were better than the heavy metal the kids usually blasted.</p><p>Waiting for Winborne, I scanned the excavation. Two test trenches had already been dug and refilled. The first had yielded nothing but sterile soil. The second had produced human bone, early vindication of Jaffer's suspicions. </p><p>Three other trenches were still open. At each, students worked trowels, hauled buckets, and sifted earth through mesh screens resting on sawhorse supports. </p><p>Topher was shooting pictures at the easternmost trench. The rest of his team sat cross-legged, eyeing the focus of his interest. </p><p>Winborne joined me on the cusp between panting and gasping. Mopping his forehead, he fought for breath. </p><p>"Hot day," I said. </p><p>Winborne nodded, face the color of raspberry sherbet.</p><p>"You OK?" </p><p>"Peachy." </p><p>I was moving toward Topher when Winborne's voice stopped me.</p><p>"We got company."</p><p>Turning, I saw a man in a pink Polo shirt and khaki pants hurrying across, not around, the dunes. He was small, almost child-size, with silver-gray hair b...</p></p><h2>Under the Black Umbrella: Voices from Colonial Korea, 1910&#x2013;1945</h2><p><p>In the rich and varied life stories in <i>Under the Black Umbrella</i>, elderly Koreans recall incidents that illustrate the complexities of Korea during the colonial period. Hildi Kang here reinvigorates a period of Korean history long shrouded in the silence of those who endured under the "black umbrella" of Japanese colonial rule.<br> <br>Existing descriptions of the colonial period tend to focus on extremes: imperial repression and national resistance, Japanese subjugation and Korean suffering, Korean backwardness and Japanese progress. "Most people," Kang says, "have read or heard only the horror stories which, although true, tell only a small segment of colonial life." The varied accounts in Under the Black Umbrella reveal a truth that is both more ambiguous and more human&#x2015;the small-scale, mundane realities of life in colonial Korea.</p><p>Accessible and attractive narratives, linked by brief historical overviews, provide a large and fully textured view of Korea under Japanese rule. Looking past racial hatred and repression, Kang reveals small acts of resistance carried out by Koreans, as well as gestures of fairness by Japanese colonizers. Impressive for the history it recovers and preserves, <i>Under the Black Umbrella</i> is a candid, human account of a complicated time in a contested place.</p></p><p>"Whereas history is usually a story of 'great men' told by its 'winners,' Hildi Kang's Under the Black Umbrella offers new insights into Korean history as it was lived every day by ordinary people. The diversity and heterogeneity of human experiences in Under the Black Umbrella challenge the oversimplified story of the Japanese colonial period in Korea that has held sway in Korean history until now."--Elaine M. Kim, University of California, Berkeley <p>"For its many voices and for the candor that comes from those voices, Under the Black Umbrella is a book of exceptional merit.Through the observations and reminiscences of Koreans who lived under Japanese rule, Hildi Kang shows us an interesting and mostly unknown picture of daily life in a neglected colony."--Bruce Cumings, University of Chicago </p><p>"Under the Black Umbrella is a pioneering collection of oral histories of Koreans who lived through the turbulent years of Japanese rule.&nbsp; It has many rich, vivid, and moving stories that reveal diversity and complexity of colonial life.&nbsp; No doubt this book will be a valuable addition to the growing body of works on colonial Korea in the West."--Gi-Wook Shin, University of California, Los Angeles</p><p>Hildi Kang is a Research Fellow at the Center for Korean Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.

MONTGOMERY attended Hopkins Grammar School, Williston-Northampton School and Williams College where he graduated in 1958. He pursued graduate studies in Religion and Economics at Yale and NYU. Montgomery was an adventurer all his life, climbing mountains in the Himalaya, skiing throughout Europe and scuba-diving wherever he could. His interested included education, macro-economics, geo-politics, mythology, history, mystery novels and music. He wrote his first interactive book, Journey Under the Sea, in 1976 and published it under the series name The Adventures of You. A few years later Bantam Books bought this book and gave Montgomery a contract for five more, to inaugurate their new children s publishing division. Bantam renamed the series Choose Your Own Adventure and a publishing phenomenon was born. The series has sold more than 260 million copies in over 40 languages. He was married to the writer Shannon Gilligan. Montgomery died in November 2014, only two months after his last book was published.Though targeted at 7-12-year-olds, the <em>Choose</em> books should appeal to kids of all ages.

How do we recognize them as members of our world? We are related to them as transient participants in common publics. Indeed, most of us would find it nearly impossible to imagine a social world without publics. In the eight essays in this book, Michael Warner addresses the question: What is a public? According to Warner, the idea of a public is one of the central fictions of modern life. Publics have powerful implications for how our social world takes shape, and much of modern life involves struggles over the nature of publics and their interrelations. The idea of a public contains ambiguities, even contradictions. As it is extended to new contexts, politics, and media, its meaning changes in ways that can be difficult to uncover. Combining historical analysis, theoretical reflection, and extensive case studies, Warner shows how the idea of a public can reframe our understanding of contemporary literary works and politics and of our social world in general. In particular, he applies the idea of a public to the junction of two intellectual traditions: public-sphere theory and queer theory.</p></p><p>Michael Warner is Professor of English at Rutgers University.

A fact-based, hands-on activity approach to teaching science, however, is not enough to help them deepen their scientific thinking or discoveries. In <i>Starting with Science: Strategies for Introducing Young Children to Inquiry</i>, Marcia Talhelm Edson explores the big ideas surrounding inquiry-based science; she helps teachers thoughtfully plan for and implement a conceptual approach to teaching and learning science so students can engage in observation, questioning, predictions, collaboration, data collection, and a deeper understanding of topics important to their lives.</p><p>Through numerous examples from classroom discussions, teacher commentary, and children's work samples, <i>Starting with Science</i> provides practical suggestions and models for beginning teachers as well as those who are fine-tuning their practice. Four key questions underlie the book:</p><ul> <li>What is inquiry-based science?</li> <li>How can pre-K, kindergarten, and primary-grade teachers incorporate inquiry-based science when faced with limited science background, insufficient time, and lack of resources?</li> <li>What roles do the children, the teacher, and the environment play in an inquiry-based science program?</li> <li>What instructional strategies are effective in implementing inquiry-based science?</li></ul><p>In answering these questions, Edson provides a framework from which teachers can devise their own in-depth inquiry investigations based on district requirements and students' own interests. She also integrates literacy opportunities as well as explicit suggestions for effective assessment of inquiry-based science.</p><p><i>Starting with Science</i> shows us what inquiry looks like in an early childhood classroom and introduces strategies teachers can employ to confidently and competently teach science to students in grades pre-K&#x2013;2. Children will gain skills for problem solving and an attitude about learning that they will carry with them not just to the next grade but throughout their lives.</p></p><p>Marcia Talhelm Edson is a clinical assistant profession in the School of Education at Boston University, USA. She focuses on inquiry-based science in early childhood education.Marcia grew up in Binghamton, NY, and after graduation from college she returned there to each fourth grade. After living in Boston during her graduate studies, she decided that New England was where she wanted to live. &#34;&#34;I enjoy the seacoast, the history, and the museums of Boston,&#34;&#34; she says.&#34;&#34;One of the things I love most about teaching is the learning that goes along with it -- learning about my students and learning about the subject matter I am teaching,&#34;&#34; Marcia says. &#34;&#34;It is an amazing endeavour with so many moving parts, so many creative possibilities, and so much responsibility.&#34;&#34;Marcia has taught preschool, elementary, undergraduate, and graduate students. &#34;&#34;At each of these levels I&#39;ve been challenged by how the brain works, how learners learn, and how I can use that information to teach,&#34;&#34; she explains. She believes that teachers must also be life-long learners. &#34;&#34;There are so many elements that are part of teaching and research is continuously providing information about how children think, how to refine instruction and assessment, how to support the social and emotional needs of children, how to engage productively with parents, and how to deal with changing social issues. Teachers need to have time to participate in well-planned, comprehensive professional development opportunities that will expand their knowledge base, fuel their curiosity, and give them a chance to collaborate and share ideas and questions with colleagues.</p><h2>Nine Tailors</h2><p>Starring Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter Wimsey, this Radio 4 dramatization was first broadcast as a weekly serial in 1980. Lord Peter, man about town and amateur sleuth, and his man Bunter, are drawn into a series of intriguing incidents after being stranded in a remote East Anglian village.</p><p>Dorothy L. Sayers was an English writer, translator, and Christian humanist. Best known for the extremely popular Lord Peter Wimsey mystery series, Sayers also penned a number of plays, including The Man Born to Be King, essays, and translations, of which she considered Dante s Divine Comedy to be her best. Sayers died in 1950, and is buried in St. Anne s Church in London.Ian Carmichael personified Lord Peter Wimsey for a generation of public television viewers. His affection for the brainy, finicky, aristocratic detective is clear in this reading. In addition to creating a well-drawn Wimsey, he imbues solid Bunter with the humor and patience that Sayers blended into his personality. All the other characters in this tale of countryside bell ringing gone wrong are so perfectly vivid that listeners may find themselves chortling with pleasure as they listen. The only quibble is that Carmichael's reading voice is the same as the one he gives to Lord Peter, leading to some confusion between the narrative and the dialogue spoken by Wimsey. But no matter, this is still a long evening's pleasure.

The result of this introspection is a remarkable memoir, instantly captivating, funny and frank, chock-full of well-earned wisdom and one-of-a-kind anecdotes from a raucous life that spans a tumultuous time of change in Britain and America. </p><p>Born during the air bombing of London in 1944, Daltrey fought his way (literally) through school and poverty and began to assemble the band that would become The Who while working at a sheet metal factory in 1961.

Daltrey was the band&#x2019;s voice, a powerhouse frontman known for his stage presence and energy.

It is astonishing how many millions of otherwise seemingly intelligent people are willing to risk their eternal destiny upon less evidence than they would require for buying a car or even a low-carb food item&#x2014;yet the belief of so many, particularly in the area of religion, has no rational or factual foundation. With well-researched arguments and compelling proof, this book demonstrates that the issue of where one will spend eternity is not a matter of preference (like joining the Elks instead of the Lions).

He received a degree in mathematics from U.C.L.A. Marriage to his wife, Ruth, was followed by the birth of four children, a career as CPA/management consultant and, later, the management of several corporations. Along with church-related activities, Dave initiated and became involved in numerous campus ministries and meetings in his home, with a special outreach to Jewish young people and foreign students. Since 1973 Dave&#x2019;s desire for fulltime ministry has found fulfillment through authorship of books dealing with the incursion, into Western culture and the church itself, of Eastern, psychological and selfist philosophies, ecumenism, and other unbiblical teachings. Concern over Islamic politics and religion are reflected in current articles, lectures and interviews. At least 4 million copies of his books have been sold and have been translated into more than 50 languages. They include: The Cult Explosion, The God Makers, The New Spirituality, The Seduction of Christianity, Global Peace and the Rise of Antichrist, Occult Invasion, A Cup of Trembling, In Defense of the Faith, An Urgent Call to a Serious Faith , What Love Is This?, Countdown to the Second Coming, Seeking and Finding God, Honest Doubts, Judgment Day! Islam, Israel, and the Nations, Yoga and the Body of Christ, and his latest book, Cosmos, Creator and Human Destiny. His video, Israel, Islam &amp; Armageddon has become a tremendous tool for churches and others interested in helping spread the truth about events prior to and since the attack on the World Trade Center. Dave&#x2019;s impeccable research and recognized scholarship are based on in depth studies of original documents and publications, interviews with key experts from around the world, and extensive travel&#x2014;including to South America, Australia, Europe and throughout the Middle East.

His beloved wife Ruth was at his side."There is no way that chemical reactions and electrical impulses among the brain's cells can explain a sense of right and wrong, the beauty of a sunset or the rational and moral choices we continually make. No material of any kind, either in the brain or outside of it, has any qualities to explain our ability to understand ideas such as truth, justice, holiness, mercy and grace. These concepts are totally non-physical. They do not originate within the brain, nor are they a conditioned response to anything anywhere in the entire physical universe. Indeed, the brain does not think at all. If thoughts originated in the brain, we would be prisoners of our brains, wondering what our brain would think of next and compelled to do whatever the brain decided. On the contrary, every person is convinced that he or she makes rational choices by weighing alternatives, not because the brain gets an impulse to make the body act in a certain way. While we are prone to react impulsively to the stimuli of physical temptations that breed lust, we are not forced to do so. The moral struggles we all experience to resist temptation are proof that we are not stimulus-response mechanisms ruled by impulses but that we do make genuine choices, though our choices are not always rational or morally right." &#x2014;Dave Hunt, SEEKING &amp; FINDING GOD, p. 9</p><h2>The Bridge of Beyond (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>This is an intoxicating tale of love and wonder, mothers and daughters, spiritual values and the grim legacy of slavery on the French Antillean island of Guadeloupe. Here long-suffering Telumee tells her life story and tells us about the proud line of Lougandor women she continues to draw strength from. Time flows unevenly during the long hot blue days as the madness of the island swirls around the villages, and Telumee, raised in the shelter of wide skirts, must learn how to navigate the adversities of a peasant community, the ecstasies of love, and domestic realities while arriving at her own precious happiness. In the words of Toussine, the wise, tender grandmother who raises her, &#x201c;Behind one pain there is another. Sorrow is a wave without end. But the horse mustn&#x2019;t ride you, you must ride it.&#x201d; <br><br>A masterpiece of Caribbean literature, <i>The Bridge of Beyond</i> relates the triumph of a generous and hopeful spirit, while offering a gorgeously lush, imaginative depiction of the flora, landscape, and customs of Gua�deloupe.

Besh is a chef with a heart. The ex-marine's passion for the Crescent City, its people, and its livelihood are main courses making him a leader of the city's culinary recovery and resilience after the wrath of Hurricane Katrina.</p> <strong>An Introduction to <i>My New Orleans</i> from John Besh</strong> <br> <p>Dear Friends,</p> <p> This book is the story of a dreamy, starry-eyed boy brought up in the shadows of New Orleans, surrounded by cypress knees and tupelo trees, good dinners and great friends. My life has been dramatically shaped by our multicultural heritage. Everything that I cook and eat, see and smell, reminds me of where I come from and more or less dictates where I&#x2019;m going.</p> <p>I grew up in Slidell, Louisiana, across Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans. My childhood revolved around the lake, and I spent many hours shrimping in its waters and fishing along its shores. I learned to cook from my mom and my grandmother, and from the men I hunted with, who held that if you hunt it and kill it, a boy like me had better know how to clean it and cook it. Ours was a house of great food--we celebrated everything from births to deaths around great food. My ideas of New Orleans's cooking come directly from the New Orleans table. My cooking draws on decades of learning and mastering cooking techniques that I felt certain would help me years down the road. I restlessly search my mind's catalog of everything I've ever tasted or cooked, so that when I see a tomato at its ripest state, my mind runs through literally thousands of preparations that could work for this here tomato. Some people may look up in the sky and notice a mallard duck, but I see a slow-roasted duckling with lots of hearty herbs, cooked down in a gravy and served over rice.</p> <p>My goal in launching Restaurant August in 2001 was to have a world-class place that could compete with the great restaurants of New Orleans. But Katrina, of course, changed everything. When the aftermath of that devastating storm threatened our fishermen and farmers, our shrimpers and oystermen, it seemed urgent to help preserve and protect our unique culinary heritage, its local ingredients, and its authentic culture.</p> <p>After Katrina, being from New Orleans became the focus of my identity. The truth is I am from here and I cook from here--our ingredients and our traditions. I believe our city is a true national treasure: We have one of the few native urban cultures--and cuisines&#x2014;that still thrives in this country. I cook New Orleans food my way, revering each ingredient as it reaches the ripeness of its season, which is how <i>My New Orleans: The Cookbook</i> unfolds, from Crawfish to Reveillon. No other place on earth is like New Orleans. Welcome to the flavors of my home.</p> <p><i>John Besh</i></p> <br> <strong>From <i>My New Orleans</i>: Drew's Chicken and Smoked Sausage Gumbo</strong> <br> <p>Throughout this book, I've had a great deal to say about making the roux that's the base of our gumbo--and the other steps as well--but I'll recap it here so that it can be useful every time you start to make our signature dish. Yes, there are other thickeners besides flour that folks use for making their roux, but to my palate, only a flour-based roux yields that traditional flavor. As for the fats in a roux, just about anything works. I love rendered duck fat, chicken fat, or lard, but canola oil works nearly as well.</p> <p>I always heat the oil first and whisk the flour into the hot oil. Not only does this speed up the process; it yields that deep, dark chocolate-colored gumbo I love. I always add the onions first to the dark roux, holding back the rest of the vegetables until the onion caramelizes. Otherwise, the water in the vegetables will keep the onion from browning and releasing its sweet juices. I like to add file powder to the gumbo, then pass it at the table, too. Serve the gumbo hot with Louisiana rice; serve potato salad on the side, if you like. <i>--John Besh</i></p> <p><b>Ingredients</b><br> (Serves 10-12)<br></p> <ul><li>1 cup rendered chicken fat or canola oil</li> <li>1 cup flour</li> <li>2 large onions, diced</li> <li>1 large chicken, cut into 12 pieces</li> <li>2 tablespoons Creole Spices</li> <li>2 pounds spicy smoked sausage, sliced 1/2 inch thick</li> <li>2 stalks celery, diced</li> <li>2 green bell peppers, seeded and diced</li> <li>1 tomato, seeded and chopped</li> <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li> <li>Leaves from 2 sprigs fresh thyme</li> <li>3 quarts chicken stock</li> <li>2 bay leaves</li> <li>6 ounces andouille sausage, chopped</li> <li></li><li>2 cups sliced fresh okra</li> <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire</li> <li>Salt</li> <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li> <li>Fil� powder</li> <li>Tabasco</li> <li>4&#x2013;6 cups cooked white rice</li> </ul> <p><b>Directions</b></p> <p>1. Make a roux by heating the chicken fat or oil in a large cast-iron or heavy bottomed pot over high heat. Whisk the flour into the hot oil. It will immediately begin to sizzle. Reduce the heat to moderate and continue whisking until the roux takes on a deep brown color, about 15 minutes. Add the onions, stirring them into the roux with a wooden spoon. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue stirring until the roux is a glossy dark brown, about 10 minutes.</p> <p>2. Season the chicken with Creole Spices. Add the chicken to the pot, raise heat to moderate, and cook, turning the pieces until browned, about 10 minutes.</p> <p>3. Add the smoked sausage and stir for a minute before adding the celery, bell peppers, tomatoes, and garlic. Cook, stirring, for about 3 minutes. Add the thyme, Chicken Stock, and bay leaves. Bring the gumbo to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 45 minutes. Stir occasionally and skim off the fat from the surface of the gumbo every so often.</p> <p>4. Add the andouille, okra, and Worcestershire and season with salt and pepper, several dashes of fil� powder, and Tabasco. Simmer for another 45 minutes, continuing to skim the fat off the surface of the gumbo. Remove the bay leaves and serve in bowls over rice. Pass more fil� at the table.</p>John Besh is a chef and a native son dedicated to the culinary riches of southern Louisiana.

Joanne defines how they differ and what they indicate in the chart. She also introduces new ideas about retrograde planets and intercepted signs, offering fresh insights for interpretation in these sometimes overlooked areas. Retrograde planets and intercepted signs make the chart unique, and each describes the powers and potentials waiting to be unleashed in your life. In some way you will stand apart from the crowd with an exceptional life that is outside the norm and as unique to you as your birth chart. Not everyone is born with such an outstanding opportunity to realize their individual potential. Included is extensive delineation of intercepted signs in the houses, the six sign polarities, the elements, duplicated signs, phases and planetary pairs. Chapters are also devoted to relocation charts, transits in intercepted signs, the importance of environment vs. destiny and various house systems. In addition to a thorough explanation of how planets retrograde, Joanne gives detailed interpretation of the meaning of retrograde planets in the natal chart and their position in the context of the eight stages of cyclic unfoldment, six of which fall into the retrograde zone. This placement specifically defines how a retrograde planet operates in your life. Also thoroughly explained is the meaning of retrograde planets in their transit cycle, and the significance of a retrograde progressed planet.</p><p></p><h2>Lonely Planet Iran 7 (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><b><i>Lonely Planet</i></b> <b><i>Iran </i></b>is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

Listen, I was outside weeding my impatiens when I saw a man ring Kara&#x2019;s doorbell. She opened the door and he started yelling at her, waving his arms around, and then he shoved her inside and closed the door. I heard her scream.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did he see you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, no, he didn&#x2019;t. He&#x2019;s a young man, Dillon, unkempt, baggy clothes, and he had a long package under his arm. I thought it could be some sort of gun.&#x201d; He wanted to tell her that was unlikely, but he&#x2019;d known Dr. Janice Hudson all his life; she&#x2019;d been a close friend of his grandmother&#x2019;s. She&#x2019;d also been a psychiatrist for more than forty years, and he could only imagine what she&#x2019;d seen in that time. He&#x2019;d trusted her instincts enough to drop everything and run over when she&#x2019;d called him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I called 911, too, but I don&#x2019;t know how long it will take them to get here. You have to help Kara, she&#x2019;s such a sweet girl. Like I told you, she&#x2019;s pregnant; the baby is due in one week. She&#x2019;s been renting the house for nearly six months and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>She drew a deep breath, got herself together. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not important. Dillon, when I saw his face, and the way he moved, stumbling and weaving when he stood in place, he seemed severely disturbed, probably medicated. Every now and then he screams at her&#x2014;there, listen!&#x201d;<br> <br>It was a young man&#x2019;s voice, a mad voice overwhelmed with panic. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to understand! You have to come with me; we have to get away from them. I know they&#x2019;re coming and they&#x2019;ll take you. You&#x2019;ve got to come away with me before it&#x2019;s too late!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who will take her? Before what&#x2019;s too late? He sounds paranoid, delusional. He&#x2019;s been yelling about the baby, ranting and cursing about some kind of gods, making no rational sense. He hasn&#x2019;t said who those gods are, but I&#x2019;m frightened for Kara, especially if he&#x2019;s armed. I&#x2019;ve dealt with people as disturbed as he is too many times in my life not to be. Dillon, you&#x2019;ve got to help her, now.&#x201d;<br> <br>Savich turned to see a police car pull up, a Crown Vic behind it. Two officers piled out of the squad car, and behind them Detective Aldo Mayer, a man other cops called Fireplug behind his back, hauled himself out of the Crown Vic, looking harassed. Savich could let Mayer deal with this. Mayer had experience, and he&#x2019;d clearly been close when the call came in. Savich saw him wave to the two officers and motion them over.<br> <br>The man screamed at them through the front window. &#x201c;I know they sent you, but how did they find me so fast? It&#x2019;s too soon! You stay away, I&#x2019;ve got a rifle. Stay back!&#x201d;<br> <br>He pushed the barrel of an AR-15 assault rifle out from between the drapes and fired. The cops scrambled for cover as bullets struck the side of the Crown Vic and the patrol car. There was silence again, except for the sirens in the distance.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dillon, they&#x2019;re not cops to him, they&#x2019;re here to take him to the people he fears. If he snaps, he might hurt Kara and the baby. His paranoia is out of control, he&#x2019;ll do whatever he thinks he has to do.&#x201d; She leaned into him. &#x201c;I know a way you can get into Kara&#x2019;s house without anyone seeing you. What do you say?&#x201d;<br> <br>Another cop car pulled up to the curb, the officers quickly taking cover. Detective Mayer shouted through a bullhorn, &#x201c;Sir, we&#x2019;re not here to do you any harm. There&#x2019;s no reason for anyone to get hurt. We can talk, we can figure this out. Tell us the problem, tell us how we can help you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t lie to me! I know who you are. They found me and sent you. I can beat them, at least for a little while. Leave or I&#x2019;ll kill you, all of you if I have to! Do you understand me? They don&#x2019;t know everything. I figured it out; I fooled them! I got away from them. Get back!&#x201d;<br> <br>Savich heard tears bubbling in his shattered voice. And a deep well of madness, and fear.<br> <br>The man screamed, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll kill everyone to stop them, do you hear me? I&#x2019;ll kill all of us!&#x201d;<br> <br>He fired off another half-dozen rounds through the small space between the tightly pulled drapes. A front tire on the lead patrol car burst, and bullets shattered the passenger-side window of the Crown Vic, sending Detective Mayer to his belly.<br> <br>They couldn&#x2019;t return fire, they had no idea where Kara Moody was.<br> <br>The distant sirens were closer now, and soon there would be pandemonium in the street. Savich would lose his chance. Dr. Janice was right: He had no choice. The man was unpredictable and dangerous, and he had an assault rifle. Savich felt the familiar weight of his Glock on his belt clip and hoped he wouldn&#x2019;t have to use it. He saw Sherlock&#x2019;s beloved face, remembered Sean&#x2019;s manic laughter when he&#x2019;d beaten his father at a new video game, and prayed he wouldn&#x2019;t take a bullet. Savich said to Dr. Janice, &#x201c;Tell me how to get in the house.&#x201d;<br> <br>As she spoke to him, Savich texted Metro detective Ben Raven.<br> <br>Urgent. Come to 2782 Prospect Street.<br> <br>Hostage situation. Mayer here. Bail me out.<br> <br>Savich heard the man yelling again, his panicked madness giving way to something like determination, and acceptance. &#x201c;I mean it! It has to stop. I won&#x2019;t let them hurt her. Leave. Tell them they can&#x2019;t have her!&#x201d;<br> <br>Savich climbed over Dr. Janice&#x2019;s fence and dropped onto Kara Moody&#x2019;s side yard. There were only three high windows on the near side of the house, no chance the man would see him. Savich pushed through a planting of red petunias and white impatiens, cut through a huge star jasmine that covered a root cellar door at the back of the house. Dr. Janice had lived next door for fifty years and knew the original owners had dug out the space to use as a bomb shelter, something from another age.<br> <br>He moved the jasmine away, saw the moldy wooden door Dr. Janice had described to him. It wasn&#x2019;t locked. The rusted handle creaked and groaned as he pulled it open and looked down at rotted wooden stairs that disappeared into blackness. He pulled out his cell phone to use as a light, and carefully stepped down the stairs until he felt the rotted wood begin to give way, and jumped, knees bent, to the dirt floor. He felt a rat carcass crunch beneath his boot, breathed in stale, nasty air, cooler than outside, and nearly coughed, but managed to hold it in. He doubted anyone had been in this shelter since the Nixon administration. His cell light haloed spiderwebs draped from open beams, crisscrossing the space, and more rodent carcasses littered the dirt floor. Jars were lined up on warped wooden shelves, covered with mold, dirt, and spiderwebs. Straight ahead another set of sagging wooden stairs led up to a door. Dr. Janice had told him it opened into a closet in the second bedroom, the baby&#x2019;s room.<br> <br>He thanked heaven for small favors when the stairs held his weight. He tried the narrow door at the top. It was locked. He grabbed the wooden rail to steady himself, reared back, and slammed his shoulder against the lock. It held. He reared back again and this time he kicked it, nearly lost his balance, and felt his heart do a mad flip. The door popped open. He prayed the man hadn&#x2019;t heard him.<br> <br>He shoved the door slowly outward, pushing aside cardboard boxes stacked against it, until he had enough of a path to pass. He eased the outer closet door open slowly and looked into a room painted a light blue. A bright mobile with the name Alex hung over a crib, and next to the crib was a rocking chair with a blue throw and a dresser painted with Walt Disney characters. Everything was ready for the baby&#x2019;s arrival.<br> <br>He stepped quietly into the hallway, guessed he was thirty feet from the living room when he heard the man screaming at the cops again. &#x201c;Bastards! They sent you, didn&#x2019;t they? But they don&#x2019;t want me dead, not yet at least, so he told you not to kill me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Savich heard Kara Moody&#x2019;s voice, soft and low, but he couldn&#x2019;t make out what she was saying. She sounded controlled, trying to keep him calm. He prayed she could hold herself together a bit longer. It might help keep the man from shooting her . . . and then possibly himself.<br> <br>Savich held his Glock at his side and walked as quietly as he could through the updated kitchen toward an arched opening to the dining room. The L-shaped living room was beyond it, and he saw Kara Moody first, her ankles and wrists duct-taped to a chair, her long straight dark hair straggling around her face. A burgundy Redskins T-shirt covered her big belly and her loose white cotton pants. Her narrow feet were bare. She was in her midtwenties, and pretty. Her eyes were fastened on her feet, trying to avoid the man&#x2019;s eyes, and his attention. Savich moved forward, saw the man standing by the window in profile, the assault rifle held loosely at his side. Savich wondered where he&#x2019;d gotten hold of that killing machine. He was swaying back and forth. Was it from stress or drugs? Probably both. He&#x2019;d sounded young, but still, Savich was surprised to see he was no older than twenty-five, slight, maybe one forty, and no taller than five foot nine. There was a light beard scruff on his narrow face. He might have been good-looking if rage and fear weren&#x2019;t contorting his face. He wore a wrinkled shirt over baggy chinos that looked like he&#x2019;d lived in them since he&#x2019;d escaped from wherever he&#x2019;d been held, from the people who&#x2019;d probably been trying to take care of him. Were they the gods he was running from, the gods he believed had found him so quickly and sent the police to bring him back?<br> <br>Savich flattened himself behind the dining room wall, next to the arched opening, and calmed his breathing. He heard Detective Mayer&#x2019;s voice on the bullhorn trying to reason with a man who had no tether to reason, offering to provide him whatever he wanted if he didn&#x2019;t harm Ms. Moody.<br> <br>The man screamed, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a liar! I don&#x2019;t believe you, not a word! I won&#x2019;t let you take me, or take her. Do you hear me?&#x201d; He let out a high, mad laugh. &#x201c;I will not let you win!&#x201d; He screamed the words again, wailed them. Then he stopped, turned to face Kara Moody, and whispered, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what to do. I&#x2019;ve got to figure this out. I want what&#x2019;s best for you, I do, only not how you&#x2019;d think. But maybe it doesn&#x2019;t matter now.<br> <br>He began shaking his head, and his free hand tugged at his hair. He was ready to break and yelled, &#x201c;What am I going to do?&#x201d;<br> <br>Kara Moody raised her head, and Savich realized she knew as well as he did it was crunch time and she had to try. &#x201c;Please listen to me. Please tell me who you are and why you want me to go with you. Go where? Who is after you? After us? Can&#x2019;t you see I&#x2019;m pregnant?&#x201d;<br> <br>He ran to her, leaned forward, cupped her chin in his hand, and jerked her face up. &#x201c;Of course you&#x2019;re pregnant. Why do you think I came? Did you call them? Did you tell them I was here?&#x201d; He stopped again, shook his head, as if trying to straighten out his thoughts. &#x201c;No, you didn&#x2019;t call them; I didn&#x2019;t let you. I had to tie you up, you know that, don&#x2019;t you? You&#x2019;d have run before I could convince you to come with me. Wait, then who called them? I don&#x2019;t understand. I don&#x2019;t understand!&#x201d;<br> <br>Savich couldn&#x2019;t act, the man was too close to her, his face nearly touching hers, close enough to kiss her. Her voice remained amazingly calm as she whispered into his face, &#x201c;No, I didn&#x2019;t call them. I don&#x2019;t like them, either. I don&#x2019;t want them to get near me. Who are you? Have I seen you before? Were you in Baltimore?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Baltimore,&#x201d; he repeated, as if trying to make sense of it.<br> <br>He reared back and screamed at her, spittle flying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m an enigma. He keeps telling me that&#x2019;s what I am, that is what we are. I can&#x2019;t let them take me, can&#x2019;t let them take you! It&#x2019;s evil, a monstrous evil!&#x201d; He shoved himself back away from her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Drop the gun now!&#x201d;<br> <br>The man whipped around at the sound of Savich&#x2019;s voice and yelled, &#x201c;No!&#x201d; He jerked up his rifle, screamed, &#x201c;How did you get in here?&#x201d;<br> <br>Savich fired, hit the gun, and sent it flying out of the man&#x2019;s hands, skidding across the oak floor to fetch up against a chair leg. The young man howled and lunged toward Kara, his hands outstretched. Savich fired again, striking him high in the shoulder. He flinched, but it didn&#x2019;t stop him. His hands were reaching toward her big belly. Savich took careful aim and fired just as Kara lurched back in the chair and it toppled over. The bullet blew a cloud of blood from the man&#x2019;s head, and he jerked backward at the impact. But it had only grazed him, and he whirled around again to face Savich. He looked confused, like a child being disciplined for something he didn&#x2019;t understand. He licked dry lips, whispered, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand. You&#x2019;re not a god. They don&#x2019;t want me dead. Who are you?&#x201d; He grabbed his shoulder when his brain finally recognized his pain, and he staggered, tears streaming down his face. He slammed his other hand to his head, and brought it down again, stared at the blood seaming between his fingers. He made a small mewling sound, his eyes rolled back in his head, and he fell on his side to the floor. He was out.<br> <br>Savich pulled Kara&#x2019;s chair back up, saw she was all right. &#x201c;Hold on.&#x201d; He knew everyone had heard the shots. He raced to the window to see a newly arrived SWAT team jogging toward the house, their weapons at the ready, bulletproof shields in front of them as they prepared to rush the house. He heard Mayer&#x2019;s voice shouting, &#x201c;Go, go, go!&#x201d;<br> <br>As if choreographed, a dozen cops rose up from behind their police cars to fan out behind them. Savich threw open the door, raised his creds in the air through the opening, yelled, &#x201c;FBI! The shooter is down! It&#x2019;s over! The shooter is down!&#x201d;<br> <br>It was as if they didn&#x2019;t see him, hadn&#x2019;t heard him, as if they were guided missiles set on their course. They kept coming. Savich understood the adrenaline rush, knew their training had hardwired them not to stop until they got to Kara Moody.<br> <br>He yelled again, &#x201c;FBI. Dillon Savich! The man is alive but he&#x2019;s down! Don&#x2019;t shoot! It&#x2019;s over!&#x201d;<br> <br>The SWAT team leader stopped, raised his hand. &#x201c;Is that you, Savich? Dillon Savich?&#x201d;<br> <br>It was Luke Palmer, twenty-year veteran, a man he&#x2019;d met a couple of years before at the gym, a man he knew was scary good at his job.<br> <br>&#x201c;Luke, yes, it&#x2019;s me, Savich! He&#x2019;s down, unconscious! Ms. Moody is unhurt.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But how did you&#x2014; Never mind.&#x201d; Luke turned, spoke to his team, then shouted to the cops surrounding the house, &#x201c;Stand down! It&#x2019;s Agent Dillon Savich. The shooter is down!&#x201d;<br> <br>There were shouts in return, and Luke yelled out again, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s over! Stand down!&#x201d; He and his people lowered their weapons and were soon all in the house. Luke paused a moment and shook Savich&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Nice work.&#x201d;<br> <br>Detective Mayer roared through the open front door, yelled, &#x201c;What do you mean it&#x2019;s over? Savich? What is the fricking FBI even doing here?&#x201d;<br> <br>Savich looked over at Mayer, a man who relied on intimidation to get his way, a man who liked to enforce rules but only if they didn&#x2019;t apply to him. He&#x2019;d always disliked Savich, called him a glory hound to his face and who knew what else behind his back. What would Mayer call him now? Savich didn&#x2019;t care. He turned back into the house. He&#x2019;d deal with Mayer later.<br> <br>He saw Luke and his SWAT team had already secured the man&#x2019;s rifle and clamped his wrists in front of him with flex-cuffs, even thou...</p><h2>Remember Who You Are: Remember Where You Are and Where You Come from</h2><p>David Icke has been a trailblazer for more than two decades, warning of the coming global facist/communist state that is now unfolding on the television news and in our daily experience. He was subjected to mass ridiculae and called a madman - but events have proved him right, and continue to do so. <p> Remember Who You Are breaks massive new ground as David connects the dots between apparently unconnected people, subjects and world events like never before. Suddenly, a world of apparent complexity, mystery and bewilderment makes sense. </p><p> The key is in the title. We are enslaved because we identify self with our body and our name, when these are only vehicles and symbols for what we really are -- Infinite Awareness, Infinite Consciousness. We are imprisoned in the realms of the five senses and "little me" when we are All That is.</p></p><p>Author David Icke has been described in many ways &#x2013; everything from a genius with amazing insight to a crazy man who needs psychiatric help. But one thing is for sure; he challenges people to think for themselves and look at the world in new ways.He is a former professional soccer player, journalist, BBC television anchorman, and national spokesman for the British Green Party, and became what some describe as 'the world's most controversial man' after discovering that society is controlled from the shadows by a network of families who own the major politicians, corporations, and media.</p><h2>Jewels of the Sun (Gallaghers of Ardmore Trilogy)</h2><p><b>BOOK ONE OF THE GALLAGHERS OF ARDMORE TRILOGY<br><br>In Gallagher&#x2019;s Pub, where the fire is burning low and the pints are waiting, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Nora Roberts has a story to tell...</b><br><br> Determined to reevaluate her life, Jude Murray flees America to take refuge in Faerie Hill Cottage, immersing herself in the study of Irish folklore and discovering hope for the future of the magical past.<br><br> Finally back home in Ireland after years of traveling, Aidan Gallagher possesses an uncommon understanding of his country&#x2019;s haunting myths. Although he&#x2019;s devoted to managing the family pub, a hint of wildness still glints in his eyes&#x2014;and in Jude, he sees a woman who can both soothe his heart and stir his blood. And he begins to share the legends of the land with her&#x2014;while they create a passionate history of their own.<br><br> <b>Don&#x2019;t miss the other books in the Gallaghers of Ardmore Trilogy<br> <i>Tears of the Moon</i><br><i>Heart of the Sea</i></b></p><p>In the small village of Ardmore, Ireland, Gallagher's pub is the center of the lively seaside community and the home of three passionate siblings: Aidan, Shawn, and Darcy. As a world traveler and a barkeep, the eldest brother Aidan has just about seen and heard it all, but when a quiet professor from Chicago enters his tavern, he is instantly intrigued--and certain that there is more to Jude Murray than what meets the eye.<p> Jude has returned to her grandmother's ancestral home to sort out her thoughts, know her heart, and "find Jude F. Murray in six months or less." After a life of deliberate security, Jude finds herself recovering from a failed marriage and a disappointing career. With the pretense of a research expedition, Jude leaves her life in Chicago and moves into the charming house on top of the faerie hill. Surrounded by the awesome scenery and relieved by the simplicity of life, Jude excuses her visions of ghosts and faeries as signs of her mental recovery.</p><p> But the inhabitants of Ardmore, and Aidan Gallagher in particular, don't dismiss these apparitions with such convenient logic, and Jude learns to listen more carefully to the messages in the world. As Aidan and Jude draw closer to each other, Jude struggles to discover, balance, and define the complex parts of her soul.</p><p> In the character of Jude Murray, Nora Roberts has created a sophisticated woman whose internal development from skittish recluse to confident lover is realistic and convincing. Carefully avoiding the "good man is a solution to all problems" plot, Roberts lets Jude and Aidan interact and develop individually, as well as together as a couple. While this modern tone is refreshing, it feels a bit at odds with the supernatural, faerie themes. As this is the first in a series about the Gallagher siblings and the faerie legend, perhaps these thematic contradictions will sort themselves out in the subsequent novels. <i>--Nancy R.E.

Since developing the GAPS nutritional protocol, Dr. McBride has received letters from GAPS sufferers all over the world: stories written by real people who have overcome their real health problems. Every one of these people has learned valuable lessons on their healing journey: lessons they are keen to pass to others who may be struggling through the same difficulties. These stories can be utilized as case studies for how to progress through personal healing and how to deal with problems that one may have to face along the way. There is nothing more valuable than real life experience! Those who have lived through something, fought the battle and won, know what is true and what is false, what works and what doesn't. Many of these stories are humbling--the kinds of horrific problems that people have had to deal with are hard to imagine for the majority of us--yet told with humor and grace!</p></p><p></p><h2>The Vision: The Dramatic True Story of One Man&#39;s Search for Enlightenment</h2><p>Tom Brown, Jr., the bestselling author of The Tracker and the acclaimed Field Guide series, simply and eloquently shares the beauty and enlightenment of his own spiritual awakening. An ancient mystical experience, the Vision Quest was undertaken by Native American Indians as an odyssey of self-knowledge and fulfillment--a spiritual journey into the wilderness and the soul. The peace, insight and sense of well-being they gained on the Vision Quest is a lasting testament to man&#39;s relationship with nature. Now, America&#39;s most respected outdoorsman reveals the secrets of this dramatic and profoundly moving ritual.</p><p>Tom Brown, Jr. began to learn hunting and tracking at the age of eight under the tutelage of an Apache elder, medicine man, and scout in Toms River, New Jersey, and is the author of 16 books on nature. He was the technical advisor on The Hunted, a major motion picture starring Tommy Lee Jones and Benecio Del Toro. In 1978, Tom founded the Tracker School in the New Jersey Pine Barrens where he offers more than 25 classes about wilderness survival and environmental protection.Explains the Indian tradition of the vision quest, shares the author&#39;s memories of his grandfather, and describes a journey of spiritual awakening.</p><h2>Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy</h2><p><p>Bernard Williams is an eloquent member of that small but important group of distinguished thinkers who are trying to erase the borders between the experts and all of us who grapple with moral issues in our own lives. In this book he delivers a sustained indictment of systematic moral theory from Kant onward and offers a persuasive alternative.</p><p>Kant&#x2019;s ideas involved a view of the self we can no longer accept. Modern theories such as utilitarianism and contractualism usually offer criteria that lie outside the self altogether, and this, together with an emphasis on system, has weakened ethical thought. Why should a set of ideas have any special authority over our sentiments just because it has the structure of a theory? How could abstract theory help the individual answer the Socratic question &#x201c;How should I live?&#x201d;</p><p>Williams&#x2019;s goal is nothing less than to reorient ethics toward the individual. He accuses modern moral philosophers of retreating to system and deserting individuals in their current social context. He believes that the ethical work of Plato and Aristotle is nearer to the truth of what ethical life is, but at the same time recognizes that the modern world makes unparalleled demands on ethical thought. He deals with the most thorny questions in contemporary philosophy and offers new ideas about issues such as relativism, objectivity, and the possibility of ethical knowledge. Williams has written an imaginative, ingenious book that calls for philosophers to transcend their self-imposed limits and to give full attention to the complexities of the ethical life.</p></p><p>Bernard Williams was White&#39;s Professor of Moral Philosophy, Oxford, and Deutsch Professor of Philosophy, University of California at Berkeley.&#x201c;Who has not asked&#x2015;if only when depressed&#x2015;&#x2018;How should I live, and how can I find out?&#x2019; To read this book is to be taken through one of the most sophisticated discussions available of such questions by an engaging, skeptical, often wryly witty and extraordinarily subtle professional.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ronald de Sousa</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Bernard Williams&#x2019;s book is better read not as an introduction to ethics, but as an attempt to take stock of the present state of the subject. As such, it is a splendid piece of work It illuminatingly maps the various tendencies and the difficulties which they encounter... Such stocktaking is much needed. Bernard Williams is probably the philosopher best placed to undertake it, and he has done it admirably.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Richard Norman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Remarkably lively and enjoyable... It is a very rich book, containing excellent descriptions of a variety of moral theories, and innumerable original and often witty observations on topics encountered on the way.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Philippa Foot</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Bernard Williams writes so elegantly that one is led to believe that his arguments are simple; they are not; they are dense and intricate, and they always repay rereading. They constitute in this book a profound critique of contemporary moral philosophy and a wonderfully subtle exploration of the ethical life we actually live (and think about) everyday.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael Walzer</b></p><h2>Night and Day (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)</h2><p><b>An immaculately-observed social comedy that explores the boundaries between personal freedom and the demands of love</b><br><br> Katharine Hilbery is beautiful and privileged, but uncertain of her future. She must choose between becoming engaged to the oddly prosaic poet William Rodney, and her dangerous attraction to the passionate Ralph Denham. As she struggles to decide, the lives of two other women&#x2014;women's rights activist Mary Datchet and Katharine's mother, Margaret, struggling to weave together the documents, events and memories of her own father's life into a biography&#x2014;impinge on hers with unexpected and intriguing consequences. Virginia Woolf's delicate second novel is both a love story and a social comedy, yet it also subtly undermines these traditions, questioning a woman's role and the very nature of experience. This edition of <i>Night and Day </i>includes a detailed introduction by Julia Briggs, which considers the key themes of the novel and its place in the tradition of social comedy, a map of central London of the period and notes.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

It is more thorough than any previous edition, as regards textual variants, explanatory notes, and the Introduction.Night and Day, Virginia Woolf&#39;s second novel, is both a love story and a social comedy in the tradition of Jane Austen; yet it also questions that tradition, recognizing that the goals of society and the individual may not necessarily coincide. At its centre is Katharine Hilbery, the beautiful grand-daughter of a great Victorian poet. She must choose between becoming engaged to the oddly prosaic poet William Rodney and her attraction to Ralph Denham, with whom she feels a more profound and disturbing affinity. Katharine&#39;s hesitation is vividly contrasted with the approach of her friend Mary Datchet, dedicated to the Women&#39;s Rights movement. The ensuing complications are underlined and to some extent unravelled by Katharine&#39;s mother, Mrs Hilbery, whose struggles to weave together the known documents, events and memories of her father&#39;s life into a coherent biography reflect Woolf&#39;s own sense of the unique and elusive nature of experience.</p><h2>Running from Safety: An Adventure of the Spirit</h2><p>A half-mile up, suspended by nylon wings and the promise of good lift, life hanges on a pledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard Bach made that pledge, fifty years before, to return to the frightened child he used to be and teach him everything he had learned from living.&nbsp;&nbsp;His promise went unfulfilled until one day, hovering between earth and sky, Richard encounters Dickie Bach, age nine--irrepressible challenger of every notion Richard embraces....<br><br>In this exhilarating adventure, Richard and Dickie probe the timeless questions both need answered if either is to be whole: Why does growing spiritually mean never growing up?

Billy recognizes that this is a politically charged case, pitting Allies against one another, and that he must proceed with caution. The Polish contingent is incensed over evidence that implicates the Russians in the murder of hundreds of Polish prisoners in the so-called Katyn Forest Massacre, and Scotland Yard thinks this murder of a Soviet officer may be a revenge killing&#x2014;perhaps perpetrated by Billy&#x2019;s friend Kaz, a Polish baron in exile.

The sky was a vibrant, vivid blue,<br> clear in every direction. The breeze out of the north felt crisp and cool at<br> our backs. Sunlight warmed our faces as it cast long, thin shadows across<br> the gray decks of the destroyer. I stood close to Diana, our hands clasped<br> discreetly amid the folds of my flapping trench coat. We were on duty<br> with the boss, but this was light duty, an excursion out of Naples harbor<br> to the island of Capri, twenty miles due south. Nobody was paying us<br> any mind, so we stood together at the rail, close, touching when we could,<br> making believe it was a holiday outing. Diana and I had been through a<br> lot, separately and together, the terrible and the wonderful. For the last<br> two days we&#x2019;d enjoyed each other&#x2019;s company as never before, as if all the<br> burdens and terrors of the past had decided to take a holiday as well. We<br> were together, neither of us in danger, and we had time alone. Nights, as<br> well as days.<br><br> I heard Kay Summersby laugh. She and the general were huddled in<br> the lee of the deck gun, sheltered from the wind. He leaned in to speak<br> to her, their heads touching. She laughed again and laid her hand on his<br> arm briefly, before she glanced at the naval officers grouped around them.<br> It was a passel of navy brass, all shiny braid, big grins, and ready with a<br> light whenever Uncle Ike pulled a cigarette from the pack in his coat<br> pocket. They reminded me of doormen at the Copley Plaza the week<br> before Christmas.<br><br> I could tell Uncle Ike was happy. He looked relaxed, and his smile<br> was natural, not the posed face he used for politicians and photographers.<br> Hell, he had just been told by the president of the United States himself<br> that he&#x2019;d been picked as Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary<br> Force. Uncle Ike had been expecting to be sent back home, or to watch<br> the big show from the Mediterranean. Instead, he&#x2019;d beat out his own boss,<br> General Marshall, and gotten the top job, along with a handshake from<br> FDR. Add blue skies and a beautiful woman to the mix and you had all<br> the wartime happiness any man could handle. This was his last day in<br> Italy, and he&#x2019;d wanted to see the famous Isle of Capri, which he had<br> ordered turned into a rest center for combat troops on leave. He&#x2019;d made<br> this cruise into a treat for the HQ staff, his family of secretaries and aides<br> who worked long hours, seven days a week, keeping the paperwork, and<br> the war, moving along.<br><br> Kay was happy, too. She&#x2019;d just received her orders to accompany<br> the general to London, along with most of his core staff. Not that<br> anyone thought she wouldn&#x2019;t, but she&#x2019;d been on pins and needles for<br> a while, especially when odds were that he was headed back to the<br> States. Kay, a British citizen, would have been left behind. When he<br> got the Supreme Commander job, I&#x2019;d almost asked Uncle Ike if Aunt<br> Mamie would move to London, but fortunately thought better of it.<br> He was my relative, of a distant sort, but he was also the highestranking<br> general this side of the Charles River, and I was a dime-adozen<br> lieutenant. And I liked Kay, whatever was going on between<br> them. Maybe nothing, maybe something. Who was I to judge? There<br> was a war on.<br><br> I sneaked a kiss, tasting the salt from the sea spray on Diana&#x2019;s lips.<br> Kay saw us and raised her eyebrows in mock horror. Diana laughed, and<br> put her arm through mine, as loose strands of her golden hair caressed<br> my face. We were in love, Diana Seaton and I. It had been rocky for a<br> while, but right now we were walking on air. I had a week&#x2019;s leave, and it<br> would be ten days before she departed for wherever the Special Operations<br> Executive was sending her. It seemed like we had forever.<br><br> &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; Diana said, pointing to Mount Vesuvius off the port bow.<br> &#x201c;Smoke.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all we need,&#x201d; I said. The night before, a thin trail of lava had<br> snaked down the mountain. The locals said it happened all the time, and<br> there was nothing to worry about, unless the mountain exploded. Then<br> worrying would be of little help, so why bother? I felt the same way about<br> the war, so I understood.<br><br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hike up there, Billy,&#x201d; Diana said. &#x201c;I want to see the crater.&#x201d;<br><br> I leaned in to whisper to her. &#x201c;Diana, in ten days you&#x2019;ll be jumping<br> out of an airplane. How about we take it easy until then?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I never said anything about an airplane, Billy Boyle,&#x201d; she said, jabbing<br> her elbow into my ribs. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not afraid of a dormant volcano, are<br> you? Or of being beat to the top by a woman?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That thing belches molten lava! But you&#x2019;re probably in better shape<br> than I am, I&#x2019;ll admit it. I haven&#x2019;t had much to do since Ireland, while<br> you&#x2019;ve been busy with training exercises.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I promise to go slowly. We&#x2019;ll pack some food in the morning, and<br> have a picnic.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;On a volcano.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It does sum things up fairly well.&#x201d;<br><br> I didn&#x2019;t argue the point. I was happy, too. Yesterday Uncle Ike had<br> pinned the silver bars of a first lieutenant on me, along with the Purple<br> Heart for a wounded arm that still ached. It was a step up from a second<br> louie, finally. He&#x2019;d apologized for taking so long, explaining that he didn&#x2019;t<br> want headquarters staff getting more than their fair share of promotions.<br> I didn&#x2019;t quibble, even though Purple Hearts are pretty rare around typewriters<br> and filing cabinets. Now I was looking forward to celebrating the<br> new year with Diana in Naples, wearing my best Class A uniform, silver<br> bars polished and sparkling in the candlelight of the fanciest restaurant<br> I could get us into.<br><br> I watched Diana gaze at the smoldering, distant mountain and wished<br> there could be a medal for her. She wore a British uniform without any<br> insignia, and few people would ever learn how she&#x2019;d served. I knew about<br> her first mission, since we&#x2019;d stumbled into each other in Algiers. But this<br> time, there wasn&#x2019;t much to go on. Of course, she wouldn&#x2019;t tell me a thing,<br> but I had noticed her practicing her Italian, speaking with any Neapolitan<br> who would spend time with her. Since most were starving, the extra<br> rations she passed around insured a steady stream of chatterboxes. So I<br> figured Italy, somewhere north of the Volturno River, which left a lot of<br> territory&#x2014;all in German hands&#x2014;where the British might want to plant<br> a spy.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Rome, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; I asked, keeping up the playful banter.<br><br> We&#x2019;d almost called it quits over her working with the Special<br> Operations Executive, until I decided it was crazy to lose her&nbsp;<i>because&nbsp;</i>I<br> was worried about losing her. I&#x2019;d taken a bullet through the arm not too<br> long ago, and that brush with death made me think things over. Maybe<br> we would both survive this war, maybe one of us, perhaps neither. So why<br> not make the best of the time we had together? I&#x2019;d decided if the choice<br> was to be happy or be miserable, why not go for happy? If either of us<br> ended up dead, at least we&#x2019;d have had our day in the sun. And today it<br> was as if happiness were contagious. Smiles all around, a beautiful day,<br> nothing to worry about for the moment, if you ignored the fitful plumes<br> of smoke rising from the volcano off the port bow.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the detective, you figure it out,&#x201d; she said, jabbing her finger<br> at my chest.<br><br> &#x201c;Italian lessons, that&#x2019;s a major clue.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We are&nbsp;<i>in&nbsp;</i>Italy, Billy. You know I enjoy languages. What better<br> place?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hmm. OK, let me think.&#x201d; I studied her, trying to summon up any<br> hint of an unusual remark or interest. The wind freshened, and she held<br> her collar up, shielding her face. I followed her to the bow. Fine mist blew<br> into our faces as the destroyer cut through the calm, pale blue waters. Diana<br> turned away from the spray, leaning against me, pressing her body against<br> mine. I put my arms around her, thinking of last night and the night before<br> in her room at the Hotel Vesuvio. It was difficult not to caress her, kiss her<br> lips again, envelop her as droplets of water cascaded over us. I resisted, and<br> returned to the guessing game at hand.<br><br> Church. She&#x2019;d gone to church with me on Sunday. I had written my<br> mother, telling her I went to Mass whenever I could. Knowing she&#x2019;d ask<br> about it in her next letter, I made sure to go at least once in Naples. Diana<br> came too, which surprised me. She&#x2019;s not Catholic, not even close. Church<br> of England, minor aristocracy, stiff upper lip. Everything the Boyles are<br> not. We yell, holler, cross ourselves, curse God, and beg the saints for<br> forgiveness. Diana had asked me about confession, communion, being<br> an altar boy, and all the other rituals of the Catholic faith as practiced at<br> the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston.<br><br> &#x201c;Turn around,&#x201d; I said. She did, her service cap pulled down tight on<br> her forehead, her stiff wool collar held against her cheeks as protection<br> against the wind. It was a familiar look, her face framed by a uniform.<br><br> &#x201c;Who was that nun you were talking with after Mass? When you left<br> me with that gasbag colonel, remember?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sister Justina? She&#x2019;s from Brindisi, as it turned out. She knew about<br> the twelfth-century mosaics in the cathedral there. We had a nice<br> chat.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I said. Diana had been to Brindisi several times. The SOE had<br> a station there. It was a good location, easy access by sea and air to<br> Yugoslavia, Greece, Crete, and Italy north of our lines. It was also the<br> seat of Italian government, at least the one now allied with us. &#x201c;How was<br> her English?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Poor. We spoke Italian. Why?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No reason, just curious. Could you understand her? I thought they<br> spoke some sort of dialect down there.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Salentino, I believe it&#x2019;s called. Yes, it sounded a bit different, probably<br> much like the Sicilian you&#x2019;ve heard. But anyone who speaks Italian<br> can understand it, even if the words sound a bit different. Why the sudden<br> interest?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m interested in whatever you&#x2019;re interested in.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m interested in climbing Mount Vesuvius with you, and enjoying<br> the whole week ahead of us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Me, too,&#x201d; I said, keeping my thoughts to myself. I wanted nothing<br> more than to spend the few days ahead with Diana, climbing<br> volcanoes if need be. But another part of me couldn&#x2019;t stop trying to<br> figure out what she was up to, and I wasn&#x2019;t smart enough to listen to<br> that distant, small voice in the back of my mind, telling me to leave<br> well enough alone.<br><br> I didn&#x2019;t. Brindisi was well south of our lines, a safe place for an SOE<br> agent to claim to be from. It made sense that Diana would want to pick<br> up some local dialect, to solidify her cover. Her Italian was fluent, but it<br> was classroom Italian, and she&#x2019;d want to sound like a native when she<br> spoke it. It was only when I saw her face framed as it would be in a nun&#x2019;s<br> habit that her trip to church with me made sense. She was going as a<br> nun, a sister from Brindisi. Maybe she&#x2019;d even taken the name Justina, if<br> they hadn&#x2019;t picked one out for her yet. There were nuns all over Italy,<br> but there was only one place the SOE was likely to send an agent disguised<br> as one.<br><br> &#x201c;The Vatican,&#x201d; I whispered to her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going as a nun.&#x201d;<br><br> Her eyes widened for a moment, and then anger narrowed them.<br><br> She moved away from me, gripping the rail with both hands. Her<br> knuckles went white.<br><br> &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t a game, Billy. You should know that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You said I should figure it out, Diana.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, let&#x2019;s see how smart Billy Boyle is. That&#x2019;s what it&#x2019;s all about, isn&#x2019;t<br> it?&#x201d; With that, she stalked off, heading into a gaggle of naval officers,<br> surrounding herself with them, sealing me off behind a wall of white hats<br> and gold braid.<br><br> I&#x2019;d gotten it wrong. Well, I&#x2019;d gotten it&nbsp;<i>right</i>, but that was the problem.<br> It wasn&#x2019;t a guessing game, it was life or death. And something beyond<br> that for Diana. It was what she needed to do to prove herself worthy of<br> living. So many people had died around her that she needed to face death<br> all over again to understand why it hadn&#x2019;t taken her. I shouldn&#x2019;t have<br> cheapened that with my guess. But I had to know where she was going,<br> in case she needed me. Knowing might allow me to pretend, at least to<br> myself, that I could protect her. Things got complicated when it came to<br> women; I wasn&#x2019;t good at complicated.<br><br> I walked back toward the bridge, where the newly promoted Colonel<br> Sam Harding was installed, monitoring radio traffic from headquarters<br> at Caserta, in case a communication needed the general&#x2019;s attention.<br> Harding was another one of the joyous crowd today, having received his<br> promotion along with me yesterday. He was now a lieutenant colonel,<br> and I knew he was happy about it because he hadn&#x2019;t frowned once all day.<br> That was riotous joy for Sam Harding, regular army, West Pointer, and<br> my immediate boss.<br><br> Before I came to the bridge, I joined Uncle Ike and Kay as the destroyer<br> changed course to starboard and the craggy white cliffs of Capri came into<br> view. The sun sparkled on the dolomite rock formations and the villas dotting<br> the beaches and hills. Kay pointed to one of the largest homes, blinding<br> white with an orange roof, remarking on its stark beauty.<br><br> &#x201c;Whose villa is that?&#x201d; Uncle Ike asked of a naval aide at his side.<br><br> &#x201c;Why, that&#x2019;s your villa, General,&#x201d; the aide said. &#x201c;Captain Butcher<br> assigned it to you.&#x201d;<br><br> The general lost his smile. He stepped away from Kay and pointed<br> to an even larger villa. &#x201c;And that one?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;General Spaatz, sir.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Damn it, that&#x2019;s not my villa! And that&#x2019;s not General Spaatz&#x2019;s villa!&#x201d;<br> Uncle Ike exploded, turning on the naval aide and forcing him back a<br> step. His face was red with anger. &#x201c;None of those will belong to any<br> general as long as I&#x2019;m boss around here. This is supposed to be a rest<br> center for combat men, not a playground for the brass.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;All the other villas on Capri have been requisitioned by the Army<br> Air Force, sir, orders of General Spaatz. General Clark reserved Sorrento<br> for army officers.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And what does that leave for the GIs coming off the line? The gutters<br> of Naples, goddamn it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, sir. I mean no, sir,&#x201d; the navy officer said, backpedaling as fast as<br> he could. He looked like he&#x2019;d enjoyed spilling the dirt on air force and army<br> brass, but both barrels of Uncle Ike&#x2019;s anger were still pointed at him.<br><br> &#x201c;Kay!&#x201d; Uncle Ike barked sharply. &#x201c;Get ahold of Captain Butcher. Tell<br> him to contact General Spaatz immediately and clear his officers out of<br> there. His action was contrary to my policy. It must cease at once.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, General,&#x201d; Kay said. &#x201c;I can call him at Caserta when we get<br> back&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Now, damn it. Right now!&#x201d; Kay stood alone, the clutch of officers<br> staring at her, each thankful he&#x2019;d kept his mouth shut. No one offered<br> the general a light.

He received many honors, including the first Distinguished Professsional Contributor Award and the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award of the American Psychological Association.The currently popular publishing ploy of presenting as "readers" the exemplary writings of individual social scientists here benefits both Carl Rogers (1902-87) and audiences familiar or unfamiliar with his multifaceted work. Most of the selections have been published previously, some as early as 1942, but they are well arranged here, forming a coherent and informative portrait of Rogers as therapist, researcher, theoretician, educator, philosopher, diplomat, and private person. While "encounter group" now seems a buzzword past its prime, the form of person-oriented encounter Rogers helped to institutionalize in clinics, schools, and other professional settings is very much a part of contemporary American social theory. Although a few very academic papers are included, this volume will interest general readers (in part if not in full) as well as specialists.<br><i>- Francisca Goldsmith, Berkeley P.L., Cal.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.&nbsp; (<i>Library Journal</i> )</p><h2>Civility</h2><p>A leading intellectual and scholar considers the causes and nature of the moral crisis in America today and offers ways in which families, individuals, and politicians can improve the country by adhering to basic principles of civility.

Arguing that the fundamental nature of international relations has not changed over the millennia, Professor Gilpin uses history, sociology, and economic theory to identify the forces causing change in the world order. The discussion focuses on the differential growth of power in the international system and the result of this unevenness. A shift in the balance of power - economic or military - weakens the foundations of the existing system, because those gaining power see the increasing benefits and the decreasing cost of changing the system. The result, maintains Gilpin, is that actors seek to alter the system through territorial, political, or economic expansion until the marginal costs of continuing change are greater than the marginal benefits. When states develop the power to change the system according to their interests they will strive to do so- either by increasing economic efficiency and maximizing mutual gain, or by redistributing wealth and power in their own favour.</p><p>Using history, sociology and economic theory to uncover the forces behind change in the world order, Gilpin demonstrates how and why the great powers and the growing powers interact in the contemporary world.War and Change in World Politics introduces the reader to an important new theory of international political change--a conceptual framework that could transform the way we think about international relations.

It is a great and welcome pleasure to read what Piatote has to say, along with the writers she represents.&#x201d; &#x2015;Laura Wexler, Yale University <br><br> &#x201c;In an interdisciplinary tour de force, Piatote demonstrates that Indian wars are wars on Indian family structures, with consequences for all: including Mormons, gays, immigrants, middle-class white men and women. <i>Domestic Subjects</i> illuminates and deepens our understanding of a shared human world.&#x201d; &#x2015;Tsianina Lomawaima, author of <i>To Remain an Indian: Lessons in Democracy from a Century of Native American Education</i> <br><br> "Piatote offers an original and luminous reading of literary works by Native American writers from the late 19th and early 20th centuries whose narratives 'illuminate and contest the force of federal Indian law and policy.' This is a must read." &#x2015;N. Bruce Duthu, Dartmouth College <br><br> "Careful, thoughtful, innovative, and deeply engaging, this book reveals how Indigenous writers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries creatively resisted assimilation and the war on Native American families by crafting dynamic alternatives to colonialism&#x2019;s narrow vision. Piatote's work is simply brilliant." &#x2015;John Borrows, University of Minnesota Law School <br><br> "Deftly weaving together analyses of literature, law, history, and gender, Beth Piatote elegantly documents how the Indigenous home became the primary site of struggle for Indigenous families against the forces of U.S. and Canadian domestication in the assimilation era." &#x2015;Margaret D. Jacobs, University of Nebraska-Lincoln <br><br> "Beth Piatote&#x2019;s <i>Domestic Subjects</i> wonderfully explores the ambivalences, difficulties, and possibilities of living through the state-organized assault on Native peoples in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, offering readings that powerfully attend to the affective life of settler colonialism." &#x2015;Mark Rifkin, University of North Carolina at Greensboro</p><h2>Reading Scripture with the Church Fathers</h2><p>Many Christians today long to become reacquainted with their ancient ancestors in the faith. They see a deeper worship and devotion in the prayers and hymns of the early church. And they believe that the writings of the early church can shed new light on their understanding of Scripture. But where and how do we begin? Our first encounter with the writings of the church fathers may seem like visiting a far country where the language, assumptions, concerns and conclusions are completely unfamiliar to us. In <em>Reading Scripture with the Church Fathers</em> Christopher Hall helps us through this cultural confusion, introducing us to the early church, its unique world, and the sights and sounds of Scripture that are highlighted for them. As Hall points out, the ancient fathers hear music in Scripture where we remain tone-deaf. Despite their occasional eccentricities, theirs is a hearing refined through long listening in song, worship, teaching, meditation and oral reading. And like true masters they challenge and correct our modern assumptions as they invite us to tune our ears to hear the divine melodies of the Bible. <em>Reading Scripture with the Church Fathers</em> is an exceptional guide. Hall provides a warm, winsome, informative and indispensable introcution to who these leaders and scholars were, how they read and interpreted Scripture, and how we might read Scripture with them for all its worth.</p><p>Christopher A. Hall (PhD, Drew University) is the president of Renovar�. He is associate editor of the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, and his books include <em>Reading Scripture with the Church Fathers</em>, <em>Learning Theology with the Church Fathers</em>, and <em>Worshiping with the Church Fathers</em>. Hall previously served at Eastern University for over twenty years in several roles, including chancellor, provost, dean of Palmer Seminary, dean of the Templeton Honors College, distinguished professor of theology, and director of academic spiritual formation. He and his wife, Debbie, live in Pennsylvania and have three grown children.These are the first two volumes published in the "Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture" series intended for educated laity and the clergy, which aims to introduce the reader to the church fathers and their exegesis of the Bible. The scope of Mark is impressive and the format generally easy to use. It presents the gospel in its entirety in the Revised Standard Version, with each passage followed by an overview of selected comments from the church fathers of the first seven centuries and then by the full comments themselves. To find these comments, the editors ran computerized searches of the whole body of patristic literature in Greek, Latin, Syriac, and Coptic; comments are limited to the church fathers, including nothing from the Arians or Gnostics, for example. Individual passages are fully referenced for easy location in the original, but while there is a list of writers at the end, there is no list of their works. From the appendix, it appears that far more passages were omitted than included, and a list of omitted passages would have been useful. Hall (biblical and theological studies, Eastern Coll.) has written a useful introduction to the series. He discusses the methods used by the church fathers in their exegesis of scripture, concentrating on Athanasius, Gregory of Nazianzus, Basil the Great, and John Chrysostom in the East and Ambrose, Jerome, Augustine, and Gregory the Great in the West, then moving back in time to their predecessors. Again, no references are made to those outside mainstream Christianity. Little is said about rabbinic or philosophical influences on the church fathers' methods, and one might wish that the influence of the New Testament, and its use of the Old, had been more fully explored. Nevertheless, this book is thorough and informative on the methods and controversies of the church fathers. For public, academic, and church libraries.?Michael S. Borries, CUNY<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Observations: Poems</h2><p><p>Marianne Moore's <i>Observations</i> stands with T. S. Eliot's <i>The Waste Land</i>, Ezra Pound's early <i>Cantos</i>, and Wallace Stevens's <i>Harmonium</i> as a landmark of modern poetry. But to the chagrin of many admirers, Moore eliminated a third of its contents from her subsequent poetry collections while radically revising some of the poems she retained. This groundbreaking book has been unavailable to the general reader since its original publication in the 1920s.</p><p>Presented with a new introduction by Linda Leavell, the author of the award-winning biography <i>Holding On Upside Down: The Life and Work of Marianne Moore</i>, this reissue of <i>Observations </i>at last allows readers to experience the untamed force of Moore's most dazzling innovations. Her fellow modernists were thrilled by her originality, her "clear, flawless" language--to them she was "a rafter holding up . . . our uncompleted building." Equally forceful for subsequent generations, <i>Observations</i> was an "eye-opener" to the young Elizabeth Bishop, its poems "miracles of language and construction." John Ashbery has called "An Octopus" the finest poem of "our greatest modern poet." Moore's heroic open-mindedness and prescient views on multiculturalism, biodiversity, and individual liberty make her work uniquely suited to our times.</p><p>Impeccably precise yet playfully elusive, emotionally complex but stripped of all sentiment, the poems in <i>Observations</i> show us one of America's greatest poets at the height of her powers.</p></p><p><b>Marianne Moore</b> (1887-1972) was an American poet, critic, editor, and translator, greatly admired for her formal innovations and her startling vision. Her poetry received many honors, including the Dial Award, the National Book Award, the Pulitzer Prize, and the Bollingen Prize.<p>&#x201c;If <i>Observations</i> appeared today readers would think it the most original and game-changing poetry of this new century. One would say that Moore had transcended all the experiments of Modernism to find a completely unique synthesis of the objective and the subjective&#x2015;unimaginably supple verse imprinted by the science of our moment, in which what it is to be virtual, material, experienced, repurposed could all be integrated into a poetry where a singular voice both has and does not have a place. The hypertrophic use of quotation moves the speaker&#x2019;s position from lyric to dramatic to epigrammatic to didactic and back in the space of a single sentence. The astonishing math of her syllabics slice and build new realities like a 3-D printer or the marvelous precisions of astrophysics. She penetrates deep space even within resistant fractal surfaces. This brilliant slender book makes Marianne Moore feel like our future. She is.&#x201d; &#x2015;Jorie Graham</p><br><p>&#x201c;Marianne Moore&#x2019;s <i>Observations</i> are personal and historical, and always intensely modern. Clearly a figurehead, she&#x2019;s armed with a quiver of wit and perfect aim. This poet bends the natural and man-made until each turn conveys a physical intellect and a music distinctly hers. Throughout this collection, Moore&#x2019;s unique signature becomes a capsule of tonal time and playful contemplation through compelling imagery. This reissue of <i>Observations</i> realigns and claims Moore&#x2019;s place within the modernist tradition as she continues to speak to us.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Yusef Komunyakaa</b></p><p>&#x201c;I have always been awed by the glittering intelligence, immense ambition, precision, formal confidence, wit, and authentic idiosyncratic imagination of Moore&#x2019;s earlier poems. Reading them, I feel I am in the presence of that rare thing, a truly extraordinary poetic mind. If, instead of reading this book yet again with the greatest pleasure and admiration, I were picking it up for the first time, I would have felt immediately sure I was in the presence of an important new voice in American poetry. These poems have always seemed totally contemporary to me, and they are some of the finest ever written in the American language.&#x201d;<b> &#x2015;Matthew Zapruder</b></p><br><p>&#x201c;Far from being an obscure or difficult poet, Marianne Mooreis one of the most lucid poets America has ever produced. The poems in <i>Observations </i>compose a collected&#x2015;and collective&#x2015;inquiry into what is valuable and why, combining two kinds of 'observation:' that of the natural scientist, whose whole occupation is engaged in unruffled looking; and that of the essayist, who arranges social experience into sentences that surprise us with the force of objects. In Moore&#x2019;s case, beautiful objects. But these poems aren&#x2019;t just ornaments: they are radical, like her witty poem about socialist carrots: 'wedge-shaped engine with the/secret of expansion.' I am grateful for this reissue, which restores poems all but lost to us. It is really the best of Moore in one portable volume&#x2015;a poetry not of the past, it seems to me, but of the future.&#x201d;<b> &#x2015;Ange Mlinko</b></p><p>&#x201c;How wonderful to have <i>Observations</i> as it was when it first appeared. Or almost. This is Moore's slightly revised 1925 version of the 1924 first edition, as strange and new and enchanting as we remember it. One's long-ago favorites are here, 'Poetry' (I too, dislike it), 'Sea Unicorns and Land Unicorns,' 'Marriage,' and above all, 'An Octopus,' one of the truly great poems of the twentieth century. In it she quotes the lines, 'complexities which still will be complexities/ as long as the world lasts,' which could be a motto for Moore's magnificent bricolage.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>John Ashbery</b></p><p>&#x201c;The sensation of reading Marianne Moore is like none other. She is the most natural, the most exotic, the most concentrated, the most circumspect, the most weirdly precise, the most beguiling poet of the twentieth century. Like explosive sunbursts, her poems sparkle with irrepressible feeling&#x2015;joy, grief, desperation, triumph&#x2015;and ask, What is virtue? What is vice? What is ugliness? What is a hero? What is love? She is my favorite American anti-poet.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Henri Cole</b></p></p><h2>Love Worth Making: How to Have Ridiculously Great Sex in a Long-Lasting Relationship</h2><p><p><b>Can sex survive monogamy?</b> </p><p>Yes, once you understand how sexual emotions really work.</p><p>This acclaimed, paradigm-shifting guide turns traditional sex therapy inside-out to reveal the hidden rules for great sex.</p><p>Gentle, compassionate, and filled with compelling stories from Dr. Stephen Snyder&#x2019;s thirty years as a sex therapist working with over 1,500 individuals and couples, Love Worth Making is essential reading for anyone hoping to keep sexual inspiration alive in a committed relationship.</p></p><p>STEPHEN SNYDER, M.D., is a sex and relationship therapist and writer, with a national reputation as one of the most creative thinkers in the sex field today.

The recent advent of environmental philosophy and posthuman studies has widened our scope of inquiry to include ecosystems, animals, and artificial intelligence. Yet the vast majority of the stuff in our universe, and even in our lives, remains beyond serious philosophical concern. </p><p>In <i>Alien Phenomenology, or What It&#x2019;s Like to Be a Thing</i>, Ian Bogost develops an object-oriented ontology that puts things at the center of being&#x2014;a philosophy in which nothing exists any more or less than anything else, in which humans are elements but not the sole or even primary elements of philosophical interest. And unlike experimental phenomenology or the philosophy of technology, Bogost&#x2019;s alien phenomenology takes for granted that <i>all</i> beings interact with and perceive one another. This experience, however, withdraws from human comprehension and becomes accessible only through a speculative philosophy based on metaphor.</p><p>Providing a new approach for understanding the experience of things <i>as</i> things, Bogost also calls on philosophers to rethink their craft. Drawing on his own background as a videogame designer, Bogost encourages professional thinkers to become makers as well, engineers who construct things as much as they think and write about them.<br></p></p><p><p>Ian Bogost is professor of digital media at the Georgia Institute of Technology. His most recent book is <i>How to Do Things with Videogames</i> (Minnesota, 2011).</p><p>"This book needs to be read by many different audiences since it is not only fascinating but also of considerable significance. As the task of thinking through things as actors in their own right according to Ian Bogost&#x2019;s maxim &#x2018;all things exist, yet they do not exist equally&#x2019; becomes a real intellectual project so the implications of this stance start to multiply. In turn, they begin to produce the outlines of a landscape in which things aren&#x2019;t just are.

As their love blooms, the fox learns of a devilish plot by a group of demons and a Japanese emperor to steal the monk&#39;s life. With the aid of Morpheus, the fox must use all of her cunning and creative thinking to foil this evil scheme and save the man that she loves.</p><p>Neil Gaiman is the most critically acclaimed comics writer of the 1990s and is the author of numerous books and graphic novels. He is the New York Times No. 1 best-selling author of American Gods and Anansi Boys. P. Craig Russell is an acclaimed artist who has worked on Sandman and Murder Mysteries, as well as adapting Wagner&#39;s Ring cycle to comics.Grade 9 Up&#x2014;A fox and a badger wager to see who can drive a monk from his temple. After they both try and fail, the badger departs in disgrace and the fox falls in love with the monk. When she learns that his life is in danger, she calls upon the King of All Night's Dreaming to help her save his life. If the story sounds familiar, that's because this book retells Gaiman's 1999 award-winning novella as a graphic novel. While the original story was illustrated with breathtaking watercolors by Yoshitaka Amano, this new adaptation looks more like the rest of the original "Sandman" series. It is divided into panels, characters speak in word balloons, and the artwork (especially that of the fox) is more cartoonlike. There are several advantages to this new approach&#x2014;readers can see the characters and the action in better detail, the graphic-novel format may attract reluctant readers, and readers get to see Dream speak in his white-on-black word balloons again. But the disadvantage of this version is that its presence eclipses the awe-inspiring beauty of Amano's work. <i>The Dream Hunters</i> is equally powerful as straight text or broken up into panels, but hopefully readers will be inspired by this book to seek out the earlier version (which thankfully is still in print) and enjoy another interpretation of the artwork for this story.&#x2014;<i>Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Many others cannot forget the betrayals of Imriel's mother, Melisande, who plunged their country into a bloody war that cost the lives of their fathers, brothers, and sons.<br> To quell the unrest, Ysandre, the queen, sets her decree. She will not divide the lovers, yet neither will she acknowledge them. If they marry, Sidonie will be disinherited, losing her claim on the throne. There's only one way they can truly be together. Imriel must perform an act of faith: search the world for his infamous mother and bring her back to Terre d'Ange to be executed for treason.<br> Facing a terrible choice, Imriel and Sidonie prepare ruefully for another long separation. But when a dark foreign force casts a shadow over Terre d'Ange and all the surrounding countries, their world is turned upside down, alliances of the unlikeliest kind are made, and Imriel and Sidonie learn that the god Elua always puts hearts together apurpose.</p><p>Jacqueline Carey is the author of short stories, essays, the nonfiction book <em>Angels: Celestial Spirits</em> in <em>Legend and Art</em>, novels <em>Godslayer</em> and <em>Banewreaker</em>, and the nationally bestselling series <em>Kushiel's Legacy</em>.

The people are in an uproar and divided in support for the lovers; far too many recall the treasonous betrayals of Imriel&#x2019;s mother that ignited a long, bloody war and claimed the lives of thousands of d&#x2019;Angelines. Ysandre will not acknowledge the affair, and if the couple marries without her blessing, Sidonie will lose her claim to the throne. Imriel knows that only an impossible act of faith on his part will satisfy the demands of Blessed Elua, the queen, and the people of the realm. For love of Sidonie and country, then, he pledges to find his mother and bring her back to execution. But there are foreigners who command powerful dark magic and want Sidonie and the throne themselves. On Longest Night, they loose that magic, plunging the d&#x2019;Angelines into forgetfulness and insanity. Imriel must come to himself to rescue Sidonie from the invader and prevent the country from destroying itself.

Burroughs comes thirteen unnerving and often breathtaking stories populated by punks and angels, skinheads and religious assassins, streetwalkers and fetishists--people who live outside the law and and the clear light of the every day. Set in landscapes as diverse as ancient Babylon, India, and the seamy underbelly of San Francisco, these daring and innovative tales are laced with Vollmann's fertile imagination. <i>The Rainbow Stories</i> ushers us into a world that bears an awful yet hypnotic resemblance to that of our deepest nightmares, confirming Vollmann's reputation as a dark visionary of contemporary fiction.</p><p>William T. Vollmann is the author of ten novels, including <i>Europe Central</i>, which won the National Book Award.&nbsp; He has also written four collections of stories, including <i>The</i> <i>Atlas</i>, which won the PEN Center USA West Award for Fiction, a memoir, and six works of nonfiction, including <i>Rising Up and Rising Down</i> and <i>Imperial</i>, both of which were finalists for the National Book Critics Circle Award. He is the recipient of a Whiting Writers Award and the Strauss Living Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.&nbsp; His journalism and fiction have been published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Harpers</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Granta</i>, and many other publications.These long, interlocking short stories comprise an anthropological field report from San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, 20 years after the Summer of Love. The author's stated goal is simply to retell--"unaltered, unverified"--the stories told to him by down-and-out street people such as Brandi the prostitute, Marisa the neo-Nazi bootwoman, and Carolina the saintly wino. Much of the action takes place offstage, in trauma centers, detox wards, and autopsy labs, with extensive footnotes citing relevant textbooks of pathology and criminal justice. This is a far more coherent book than Vollmann's first novel, You Bright and Risen Angels ( LJ 5/15/87), and clearly places him in the front ranks of contemporary authors. Highly recommended, but definitely not for the squeamish.<br><i>- Edward B. St. John, Loyola Law Sch.

Now available in paperback, this collection of three long stories, three short ones, and a theoretical postface by one of North Africa's leading writers depicts the plight of urban Algerian women who have thrown off the shackles of colonialism only to face a postcolonial regime that denies and subjugates them even as it celebrates the liberation of men. Denounced in Algeria for its political criticism, Djebar's book quickly sold out its first printing of 15,000 copies in France and was hugely popular in Italy. Her stylistically innovative, lyrical stories address the cloistering of women, the implications of reticence, the connection of language to oppression, and the impact of war on both women and men.

He did so by wedding the language of common speech to metrical verse, creating a medium that could accommodate tales of courtly romance, bawdy <i>fabliaux</i>, astute psychological portraiture, dramatic monologues, moral allegories, and its author&#x2019;s astonishing learning in fields from philosophy to medicine and astrology.

Morrison's introduction is vital for its insights into Chaucer as man and artist, and as a product of the Middle Ages whose shrewdness, humor, and compassion have a wonderfully contemporary ring.</p><p><b>Geoffrey Chaucer</b> was born in London, the son of a wine-merchant, in about 1342, and as he spent his life in royal government service his career happens to be unusually well documented. By 1357 Chaucer was a page to the wife of Prince Lionel, second son of Edward III, and it was while in the prince's service that Chaucer was ransomed when captured during the English campaign in France in 1359-60. Chaucer's wife Philippa, whom he married c. 1365, was the sister of Katherine Swynford, the mistress (c. 1370) and third wife (1396) of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, whose first wife Blanche (d. 1368) is commemorated in Chaucer's ealrist major poem, <b>The Book of the Duchess</b>.<p>From 1374 Chaucer worked as controller of customs on wool in the port of London, but between 1366 and 1378 he made a number of trips abroad on official business, including two trips to Italy in 1372-3 and 1378. The influence of Chaucer's encounter with Italian literature is felt in the poems he wrote in the late 1370's and early 1380s &#x2013; <b>The House of Fame</b>, <b>The Parliament of Fowls</b> and a version of <b>The Knight's Tale</b> &#x2013; and finds its fullest expression in <b>Troilus and Criseyde</b>.</p><p>In 1386 Chaucer was member of parliament for Kent, but in the same year he resigned his customs post, although in 1389 he was appointed Clerk of the King's Works (resigning in 1391). After finishing <b>Troilus</b> and his translation into English prose of Boethius' <b>De consolatione philosophiae</b>, Chaucer started his <b>Legend of Good Women</b>. In the 1390s he worked on his most ambitious project, <b>The Canterbury Tales</b>, which remained unfinished at his death. In 1399 Chaucer leased a house in the precincts of Westminster Abbey but died in 1400 and was buried in the Abbey.</p><p></p>Text: English (translation)</p><h2>Britain BC: Life in Britain and Ireland Before the Romans</h2><p><p>An authoritative and radical rethinking of the history of Ancient Britain and Ancient Ireland, based on remarkable new archaeological finds.</p><p>British history is traditionally regarded as having started with the Roman Conquest.

Foot traffic had been scarce, and would be, she knew, for another two weeks, at least until the St. Dennis Secret Garden Tour brought the first of the serious visitors to town. And that was just fine with her. Once the tourist season began in earnest, there would be fewer opportunities for dinners with friends or for closing early to enjoy slow walks through the town she had come to call her own.<br><br>She turned the dead bolt on the door leading down into the basement, then let herself out through the front and locked that door behind her as well. She paused to take a deep breath of the spring fragrance which she found unique to St. Dennis: salt from the Bay mixed with the scent of the hyacinths, daffodils, and early tulips planted in the wooden barrels&#x2014;?compliments of the garden club&#x2014;that stood outside each of the shops along Charles Street. The very colors of the flowers said spring to her: purples and pinks, yellows and whites. Just to see them made her smile.<br><br>She stepped back to take a good long look at the window she&#x2019;d spent most of the day designing. Was it too early to display the tennis whites and the pastels that many of the local ladies liked to sport while golfing at the new country club outside of town? Maybe she should move those items to the smaller windows on the side of the shop, and dress her mannequins in something other than sportswear. Maybe those pretty cocktail dresses she got in from New York last week, and maybe a few of those darling evening bags from that designer she found in Cape May over the winter.<br><br>The promise of warm weather put a bounce in her step, and as she crossed the street, visions of all the new items she&#x2019;d recently ordered for Bling danced in her head.<br><br>&#x201c;Step lively there, miss,&#x201d; the driver of the car that had stopped to let her cross called out. &#x201c;Or I&#x2019;ll have to arrest you for jaywalking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, you . . .&#x201d; Vanessa laughed. &#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t you out chasing bank robbers or car thieves?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There hasn&#x2019;t been a bank robbed in St. Dennis for as long as I&#x2019;ve lived here.&#x201d; Gabriel Beck&#x2014;chief of police and Vanessa&#x2019;s half brother&#x2014;pulled his car to the side of the road and activated his flashing lights. &#x201c;And the last report of a stolen car we received turned out to be Wes Taylor&#x2019;s fifteen-year-old son sneaking out in the middle of the night to see his girlfriend.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Slow day, eh, Beck?&#x201d; She walked over to the car and leaned into the open passenger-side window.<br><br>&#x201c;Just another day in paradise.&#x201d; He hastened to add, &#x201c;Not that there&#x2019;s anything wrong with that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, wait another few weeks. Once the tourists start pouring into town, you&#x2019;ll be wishing for a day like this, when you can cruise around town in your spiffy new official police-chief car and stop to chat with the locals.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only way to stay in touch, kiddo.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I admit I like the calm before the storm. I like to be able to close up shop at six and have the evenings to myself. I know it won&#x2019;t last&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m grateful that my shop does so well. But it&#x2019;s nice to have some quiet days to enjoy this glorious weather before the crowds arrive.&#x201d; She stood to wave to the driver of a passing car. &#x201c;So where&#x2019;s the fianc�e?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I dropped her off at BMI early this morning. She&#x2019;s on her way to Montana to see her brother.&#x201d; He glanced at his watch. &#x201c;Actually, she should be arriving at his place anytime now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is this her brother the hermit?&#x201d; The one I like to think of as Mountain Man?<br><br>Beck nodded. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s hoping to talk him into walking her down the aisle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your wedding&#x2019;s in five weeks.&#x201d; Vanessa frowned. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t she cutting it a bit close?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She already asked her other brother, Andy, and he&#x2019;s on board. But she wants them both to give her away, since their dad died last year.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I wish her luck with that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, me, too. I offered to go with her, but she thought she&#x2019;d have a better chance on her own. Mia doesn&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s left his place for any length of time since their dad&#x2019;s funeral. We&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t appear optimistic. &#x201c;So where are you off to now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m meeting Steffie for dinner.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;s closed up yet. There was a group in town this afternoon for a lecture over at the Historical Society. From the crowd gathered outside Steffie&#x2019;s, I&#x2019;d say they all stopped at her place for ice cream before getting back on their bus.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks for the tip. I&#x2019;ll walk on down and see if I can give her a hand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You just want ice cream,&#x201d; he teased, and put the car in drive.<br><br>&#x201c;You know what I always say.&#x201d; She stepped back onto the curb. &#x201c;Eat dessert first.&#x201d;<br><br>She waved good-bye as he pulled away, and glanced back at Bling, the front window dressing still on her mind. She mentally slapped herself on the forehead. Duh. The display should reflect the upcoming wedding. Pretty dresses and shoes to wear to the event. Flowers&#x2014;maybe some terra-cotta pots planted with something colorful across the front of the window. Pans?ies, maybe. Vases of budding flowering cherry in the corners. Lots of white chiffon, puffed like clouds . . .<br><br>It was less than a ten-minute walk from Bling to Steffie Wyler&#x2019;s ice-cream shop. Her arms swinging, Vanessa strolled along, marveling, as she always did, at the twists and turns her life had taken since she first arrived in St. Dennis. It was hard to believe that just three short years ago, she&#x2019;d been destitute and exhausted mentally and physically from the stress of removing herself from a marriage that had started to go bad even before the petals had begun to drop from the yellow roses she&#x2019;d carried on her wedding day. Even now, the mere sight of yellow roses could make her knees go weak.<br><br>That was then, she reminded herself sternly. This is now. No need to go back to that place and time. Keep the focus on all the good things that have happened since I came to St. Dennis.<br><br>Finding that she had a half brother&#x2014;finding Beck&#x2014;was probably the best thing that had ever happened to her. That he and his father, Hal Garrity, had welcomed her so warmly, had urged her to stay, and had offered to help her start up a business in a storefront that Hal owned just when St. Dennis was emerging as a tourist attraction . . . well, who could have foreseen all that happening?<br><br>Timing is everything, she reminded herself. Everyone knows that.<br><br>She waved through the window of Lola&#x2019;s Caf� at Jimmy, one of Lola&#x2019;s geriatric waiters, and passed Petals &amp; Posies, the flower shop next door, where tall galvanized steel containers outside held long branches of blooming forsythia and pussy willow, and the windows held the eye with a rainbow display of cut tulips and daffodils.<br><br>Next to Petals &amp; Posies, at the corner, was Cuppachino, where many of the townies gathered first thing in the morning for coffee, the latest gossip, and to watch the news on the big-screen TV that hung on the side wall before heading off to their respective mornings. Through the screened door, propped open to encourage the evening breeze to enter, Vanessa noticed Grace Sinclair, the owner and editor of the local weekly paper, the St. Dennis Gazette, at one of the front tables. She was deep in conversation with Amelia Vandergrift, the president of the garden club. Gathering tidbits for a piece on the upcoming tour, no doubt, to remind everyone to buy tickets to the event. Vanessa considered Grace, a white-haired septuagenarian with unlimited energy who knew everyone and everything, the town&#x2019;s number one cheerleader. Secretly, Vanessa attributed half of what she&#x2019;d learned about St. Dennis to Hal, and the other half to Grace Sinclair&#x2019;s weekly editorials about the community.<br><br>She rounded the corner of Charles and Kelly&#x2019;s Point Road, and moments later, passed the municipal building, with its new wing that housed the police department. She noted that Beck&#x2019;s car had not yet returned to its designated parking space.<br><br>Probably out doing what he does best, she mused. Reassuring the locals that all is just skippy in St. Dennis.<br><br>At the end of the road, right where it T&#x2019;d into the wooden boardwalk that ran next to the Bay, stood One Scoop or Two, the onetime crabber&#x2019;s shanty Steffie Wyler had turned into a charming ice-cream parlor. Seeing the crowd gathered around the tables out front of the small structure, Vanessa quickened her step. She excused herself to those patrons waiting patiently in line, smiling as she walked around them and between the two freezer cases to grab an apron off the pegs that hung behind the cash register.<br><br>&#x201c;I can help the next person in line,&#x201d; Vanessa announced. She slipped on a pair of thin, clear plastic gloves as a pleasant white-haired gentleman stepped up to place his order.<br><br>&#x201c;I owe you big-time, babe,&#x201d; Steffie whispered in Vanessa&#x2019;s ear on her way to the cash register.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, you do. And you&#x2019;ll pay up.&#x201d; Vanessa smiled and turned to the customer. &#x201c;Sir, did you want the blackberry or the chocolate on the bottom?&#x201d;<br><br>Thirty minutes and four dozen customers later, the crowd had been served and the last cone dipped.

Volatile, impulsive, irritable, and self-pitying, Adams seemed temperamentally unsuited for the presidency. Yet in many ways he was the perfect successor to Washington in terms of ability, experience, and popularity. </p><p>Possessed of a far-ranging intelligence, Adams took office amid the birth of the government and multiple crises. As well as maintaining neutrality and regaining peace, his administration created the Department of the Navy, put the army on a surer footing, and left a solvent treasury. One of his shrewdest acts was surely the appointment of moderate Federalist John Marshall as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. </p><p>Though he was a Federalist, Adams sought to work outside the still-forming party system.

And yet John Quincy fell in love with her, almost despite himself. Their often tempestuous but deeply close marriage lasted half a century.&nbsp;<br><br> They lived in Prussia, Massachusetts, Washington, Russia, and England, at royal courts, on farms, in cities, and in the White House. Louisa saw more of Europe and America than nearly any other woman of her time. But wherever she lived, she was always pressing her nose against the glass, not quite sure whether she was looking in or out. The other members of the Adams family could take their identity for granted&#x2014;they were Adamses; they were Americans&#x2014;but she had to invent her own. The story of Louisa Catherine Adams is one of a woman who forged a sense of self. As the country her husband led found its place in the world, she found a voice. That voice resonates still.&nbsp;<br><br> In this deeply felt biography, the talented journalist and historian Louisa Thomas finally gives Louisa Catherine Adams's full extraordinary life its due. An intimate portrait of a remarkable woman, a complicated marriage, and a pivotal historical moment, Louisa Thomas's biography is a masterful work from an elegant storyteller.</p><p><b>Louisa Thomas</b>&nbsp;is the author of <i>Mind and Matter: A Life in Math and Football</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Conscience: Two Soldiers, Two Pacifists, One Family&#x2014;a Test of Will&nbsp;and</i>&nbsp;<i>Faith in World War I</i>.

When he came to dinner at the Johnsons&#x2019; house in London, on Wednesday, November 11, 1795, the young American diplomat was dressed in a strange boxy Dutch coat so pale that it appeared, absurdly, almost white. Watching him talk at the table, though, she did like him. He seemed spirited, showing no signs of exhaustion after a long and difficult journey from Holland, where he was the United States&#x2019; representative. He was handsome, with penetrating, dark round eyes under a pair of peaked eyebrows, and a mouth that was full and strong. He liked a good story and a good glass of wine. Only twenty-eight years old, he was already a high-ranking diplomat&#x2014;and the son of the vice president of the United States. No one who met him could miss his intense intelligence. Still, after John Quincy had gone, the girls sat in the parlor and joked a little about his unfashionable attire. They were drawn to men who wore well-cut jackets, men who arrived at dinner looking ready for a gallop. John Trumbull, an artist and frequent guest at the Johnsons&#x2019;, who had brought John Quincy to dinner, tried to convince them that Mr. Adams was &#x201c;a fine fellow and would make a good husband.&#x201d; The sisters laughed.</p><p>More than a month passed before John Quincy came back, and Louisa did not miss him. She was twenty years old, clever, and charming, though she could be shy, and she and her sisters were accustomed to being objects of admiration. There were seven daughters in all&#x2014; beguiling, lively, and lovely&#x2014;and their mother, Catherine, knew how to exploit their good looks. (A seventh child, a son named Thomas, was at boarding school and then across the Atlantic at Harvard.) Catherine was petite and pretty, with a sparkling wit and a talent for putting guests at ease while keeping them on their toes; she was, Louisa remembered, &#x201c;what the French call spiritu�l.&#x201d; When they were little, Catherine had dressed her children in matching clothes and marched them into church by twos. &#x201c;We were objects of general curiosity and permit me to say admiration to the publick,&#x201d; Louisa would remember with a touch of unembarrassed pride. When they were older, the girls had ostrich feathers for their hats, buffons of starched muslin, and hairdressers to curl, sculpt, and powder their hair. They ordered gloves by the dozen. The three oldest&#x2014;Nancy was twenty-two, two years older than Louisa, and Caroline eighteen, two years younger&#x2014; had already been introduced to society, and society was happy to be introduced to them.</p><p>There were frequent visitors to entertain them, dinners with dignitaries, merchants, scientists, ministers, British abolitionists, wealthy American plantation owners, young men and old. Their elegant house, No. 8 Cooper&#x2019;s Row on Tower Hill, perched above the Thames and the Tower of London, was known as a welcoming place. Visitors from the United States were treated especially well. Louisa&#x2019;s father, Joshua Johnson, a merchant from Maryland, was the American consul in London, appointed by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson in 1790. He interpreted his responsibilities liberally. (Perhaps a little self-interestedly, too, which was not uncommon for a consul.) His ships carried Americans&#x2019; mail to and from the United States; he found them a doctor when they were sick; he pled their case when they were in trouble; he offered his house as their haven. Americans came to Cooper&#x2019;s Row to collect their letters and stayed for tea. They came to discuss a trading scheme and found themselves at dinner. After dinner they would linger for card games, conversation, and music in the parlor. They came for the comforts of the sofa in the parlor, the oil paintings on the walls, the cook in the kitchen, the harp in the corner, and the eleven servants who would suddenly appear at their elbow to whisk away their finished plates or materialize in the drawing room with a glass of good brandy. They also came, perhaps, for the women.</p><p>Louisa barely noticed John Quincy&#x2019;s reappearance at the dinner table in December, but he returned and returned again. He could be found on Tower Hill almost every night. He would linger after dinner with the sisters to watch their skits, play their games, and listen to their laughter. He teased them and was teased; they called him &#x201c;Mr. Quiz.&#x201d; He sat on the sofa next to Louisa and held the end of a string as Louisa threaded spangles on it for her embroidery. He loved watching them perform&#x2014;Nancy played the pianoforte, Caroline the harp, and Louisa sang. &#x201c;Evening at Mr. Johnson&#x2019;s. His daughters pretty and agreeable . . . Late home,&#x201d; he would record in his small, strict handwriting, logging his visits to the Johnsons&#x2019; night after night.</p><p>He was drawn to them, this warm feminine circle&#x2014;to the sound of a soprano voice, the mellifluous laughter, the suggestion of a life not of strain and hardship but of modestly easy luxury. It was so different from the atmosphere of expectations in which he&#x2019;d been raised, so different from what he told himself he wanted. He noted the difference and it disturbed him; yet he could not seem to stay away.</p><p>The Johnson sisters could sense the increasing attention from this almost-stranger, serious and somewhat supercilious, though not unable to smile. He was unusual&#x2014;but then, there were ways in which they were unusual too&#x2014;and perhaps Louisa most of all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>. . .</p><p>She was almost an outsider by birth. At the time the American Revolution broke out across the Atlantic, when she was only two months old, her father was the buyer for a firm based in Annapolis. He was a proud American patriot unafraid to show his allegiance, which meant that it became neither safe nor profitable for him to live nearly in view of the Tower of London. When Louisa was three, her family moved to Nantes, France, where Joshua worked for a time as an agent for the nascent American government and tried to establish his own business. His house there, on L&#x2019;�le Feydeau, in the middle of the Loire River, the part of town fashionable among the newly rich, became a frequent meeting point for Americans passing through&#x2014; Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Paul Jones, and dozens of others, including John Adams, perhaps with his middle son in tow. They came for business, and perhaps for pleasure; Joshua Johnson projected a sense of living well. His apartments were in a mansion called &#x201c;Le Temple du Go�t&#x201d;&#x2014;the Temple of Taste. Rows of wrought iron balconies curved and curled into delicate tendrils; long windows opened like doors; the fireplaces were made of marble; and the ceilings soared. Later, Louisa blamed Le Temple du Go�t for encouraging a certain showiness and ruinous cupidity in her mother, but it molded her own aesthetic as well. Long after she had been to the Hermitage, to the Tuileries, to Peterhof, to Sans Souci, she would remember Le Temple du Go�t as a singular marvel, elegant and perfect.</p><p>She remembered her childhood, she would later say, like a dreamscape. She wouldn&#x2019;t remember the revolutionaries who came to tea, though&#x2014;they meant little to her then, and anyway, she often wasn&#x2019;t home. Her parents sent her to a Roman Catholic boarding school located in Le Temple du Go�t, up the mansion&#x2019;s spiral staircase. The Johnsons weren&#x2019;t Catholic, and Joshua probably wasn&#x2019;t too interested in formally educating his tiny children at that point. (Americans in France sometimes enrolled their children in Roman Catholic schools; Thomas Jefferson&#x2014;highly skeptical of religion&#x2014;sent his daughter Patsy to a convent.) But Catherine was frequently pregnant, all the Johnsons often sick, and Joshua prone to feeling overwhelmed. The school left an impression on Louisa, though the only nun she could later recall was the one who brought toys. What she would remember were the trips to convents and cathedrals, where she would stand in the tinctured light and then drop to her knees to pray before the cross. She was imprinted with a certain sacerdotal sensitivity, an openness to awe. She also would remember the French she learned.</p><p>The school was only upstairs from her parents&#x2019; family, but to judge from how much she liked to come home&#x2014;even if it meant falling sick&#x2014;it felt far away. With her mother, the lessons were of a different order. Louisa learned to dance on top of a table. Catherine dressed her children in the latest French fashions, in silks and tiny hoops, and took them to children&#x2019;s balls, where they were exhibited, admired, and &#x201c;perfectly ruined by adulation and flattery.&#x201d; One of Louisa&#x2019;s earliest childhood memories, a kaleidoscope of colors and textures, was of a party&#x2014;in fact a wedding. Late in her life, she could still picture the bride of her father&#x2019;s coachman: the f lowers on her dress, the flowers in her hands, the flowering flush upon her cheeks. The bride opened the ball, Louisa wrote in 1825, &#x201c;with all the gaiety of French sprightliness.&#x201d; In 1781, Joshua rejoined his old partner Charles Wallace and another Annapolis merchant, John Muir, to form Wallace, Johnson &amp; Muir, focusing on commission trade with Europe. Two years later, when Louisa was eight, with the end of the Revolution imminent, the Johnsons returned to London. They moved into the graceful mansion on Tower Hill, a short walk from the fortress and the long artery to the sea below it. Louisa and her sisters were sent to a boarding school in Shacklewell, near Hackney, about four miles north of Tower Hill. The school aimed at preparing middle-class English girls to become marriageable young women; it was run by a headmistress named Elizabeth Carter, who was well read, somewhat narrow minded, and very fat. Students were taught drawing, needlepoint, how to play the harp, and sloppy French&#x2014;all considered necessary adornments for a wife.</p><p>Louisa was young and shy, which at times could make her seem haughty; the other girls called her &#x201c;Miss Proud.&#x201d; Later in her life, she would remember a persistent feeling that she did not fit in. She had arrived at school wearing a stiff silk dress, as was the style in France, and chattering with her sisters in French only to find her schoolmates wearing high-waisted frocks with pretty sashes and f lowing chemise skirts, speaking in proper English idioms coded with signals of birth and bearing. Louisa and her sisters, she wrote in &#x201c;Record of a Life,&#x201d; &#x201c;became objects of ridicule to the whole school.&#x201d; But Louisa&nbsp;<i>was&nbsp;</i>also proud. Being different might mean being something more than ordinary. There was power in that. She had an innate f lair for the dramatic. A story about the first time she went to a church service with her schoolmates in Hackney is telling: when a teacher told her to kneel to pray, she &#x201c;fell as it were dead upon the floor.&#x201d; Echoing what she&#x2019;d heard from the nuns at the Catholic school she had attended at Le Temple du Go�t, she declared that she was surrounded by &#x201c;<i>hereticks.</i>&#x201d; Likely, her fear of heresy and hell was real and overwhelming; young and impressionable, she had been influenced by what the nuns had told her. But her response was assertive and perhaps a little strange, since her own parents went to an Anglican church (and, when she was home, she likely went with them), and since her sisters seem to have had no similar trouble. She was sensitive, and she had a sense that those around her believed and behaved unlike her.</p><p>What happened next, after the fainting, was also characteristic: Louisa fell so &#x201c;ill&#x201d; she had to be removed from school. This time she did not go home. Instead, her parents, distracted by the demands of their growing family, their own frequent illnesses, and the vagaries of a merchant&#x2019;s business, sent her to stay with family friends, John and Elizabeth Hewlett. Parents could be remote, if not seemingly indifferent, in the eighteenth century; nonetheless, sending Louisa to friends seems harsh. Yet Louisa came to see it as a blessing. It shaped her independence and intellect at a very early age. Elizabeth Hewlett was the widow of another American merchant who had remarried a young, bold-minded Anglican minister named John. Louisa&#x2019;s father, Joshua, deferred to John Hewlett in religious and educational matters&#x2014;not so much, it seems, because he admired Hewlett&#x2019;s renowned scholarship as because he admired his connections. Anglicanism made sense for a socially ambitious family in England, and Joshua did not care what dogma his daughters actually believed. He had been raised on a Chesapeake plantation, where women were worshipped but not for their independent minds. What mattered was that his daughter not make a fuss. A lady was not supposed to disagree with the minister&#x2019;s creed, much less faint upon the floor. Joshua asked John Hewlett to coax Louisa into line. &#x201c;As in regard to women he always said there was little danger in believing,&#x201d; Louisa later wrote of her father, but &#x201c;there was destruction in doubt.&#x201d;</p><p>John Hewlett did bring her around to a more or less conventional religious view (although, she would write in 1825, &#x201c;I am not quite sure that some people do not think me a little of a fanatic even now&#x201d;). But he did something that Joshua did not intend when he asked John to minister to Louisa: he listened to her, talked with her, recommended books for her to read, and treated the child with unusual respect. On her visits over the years, he and Louisa would engage in &#x201c;serious conversation.&#x201d; His wife, too, treated her with unusual attention and care. Elizabeth Hewlett was &#x201c;a very eccentric woman of strong mind and still stronger passions.&#x201d; She was a woman for the age of sensibility&#x2014; but also a counterpoint to the woman Louisa would have encountered in popular advice manuals of the day. Elizabeth was not quiet and delicate; she did not blush and fade. So forceful was her personality that her neighbors, including the formidable Mary Wollstonecraft&#x2014;the author of&nbsp;<i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&#x2014;</i>found her bossy and intimidating. (Wollstonecraft, at the time a local schoolmistress, complained of Elizabeth&#x2019;s power over John Hewlett: &#x201c;How he is yoked!&#x201d;)</p><p>John Hewlett, Louisa wrote, &#x201c;led me early to think.&#x201d; Thinking was not something that most young women were encouraged to do. John Hewlett was something of a radical. He ran a boys&#x2019; school in Shacklewell and was a sizar of Magdalen College at Oxford, and he would go on to have an illustrious career as a scholar and preacher, but in the 1780s and 1790s, his friends included famous dissenters and writers, and he had unusual ideas about the education of young women. Even as he was encouraging Louisa, John was urging Mary Wollstonecraft to write an essay about her ideas about the education of young women, which he carried to the publisher himself. Though&nbsp;<i>Thoughts on the Education of Daugh�ters&nbsp;</i>was less explosive than Wollstonecraft&#x2019;s more famous work<i>,&nbsp;</i>it still had an incendiary message: a woman should learn to think for herself.</p><p>So Louisa began to imagine she might have a mind of her own, which further set her apart. &#x201c;At school,&#x201d; she later wrote, &#x201c;I was universally&nbsp;<i>respected</i>, but I was never beloved.&#x201d; While she was there, she and her best friend, Miss Edwards&#x2014;another misfit, &#x201c;an East Indian very dark, with long black Indian hair; not handsome, but looked...</p></p><h2>The Perfect Waltz (Merridew Series)</h2><p>Society rogue Sebastian Reyne's search for a practical wife comes to a crashing halt when he dances with the effervescent Hope Merridew--and is seduced into a delicious intrigue of sensuality and desire. <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><b>Anne Gracie</b>&nbsp;is the award-winning author of the Chance Sisters Romances, which include&nbsp;<i>The Spring Bride</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Winter Bride</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Autumn Bride</i>.

Davis is one of the finest cartoonists of her generation, and has been producing comics since the mid-2000s. Happy represents the best stories she&#x2019;s drawn for such curatorial venues as Mome and No-Brow, as well as her own self-publishing and web efforts. Davis achieves a rare, subtle poignancy in her narratives that are at once compelling and elusive, pregnant with mystery and a deeply satisfying emotional resonance. Happy shows the full range of Davis&#x2019;s graphic skills &#x2015; sketchy drawing, polished pen and ink line work, and meticulously designed full color painted panels&#x2015; which are always in the service of a narrative that builds to a quietly devastating climax.</p><p>Raised in Tucson, Arizona, Eleanor Davis lives in Athens, Georgia with her husband, the cartoonist Drew Weing.&#x201c;The success of this collection suggests that short pieces are likely Davis' m�tier, but what's here is so accomplished that it's natural to hope for a book-length work next time out.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Gordon Flagg, <em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;...<em>How to be Happy</em> [is] an imaginative collection of graphic literary short stories...

In her roundabout way, she dramatizes not the prospect of happiness, but the promise of it.

And what art it is: there may be nothing Davis can&#x2019;t beautifully illustrate. ...<em>How to Be Happy</em> is fearless and fantastic, unafraid to break rules or to make new ones.</p> &#x201d;<br> - <strong>Hillary Brown, <em>Paste</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[Starred Review] The excellence and variety of the art in this short comics story collection is matched only by the painful incisiveness of the stories, most circling around attempts both foolish and sincere to find happiness. Some of Davis's art styles are reminiscent of her children's books (Secret Science Alliance, Stinky)&#x2015;simple supple black and white line drawings&#x2015;others resemble Little Golden Books, bright blocks of colors and button nosed characters, but only as if written by Raymond Carver. ...

From the self-mocking haikus of Zen masters on their deathbeds to the last words of Christian saints and modern-day sages, this irresistible book contains much to inspire both amusement and reflection.</p><p>Informed by Critchley's acute insight, scholarly intelligence, and sprightly wit, each entry tells its own tale, but collected together they add up to a profound and moving investigation of meaning and the possibility of happiness for us all.<br><br>&nbsp;</p></p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, February 2009</b>: For professor Simon Critchely, how we die is possibly more important than how we lived. In <i>The Book of Dead Philosophers</i>, Critchley presents a lineup of nearly 200 famous (and not so famous) philosophers and explores how, through their deaths, one might be inspired to lead a richer life. From a few words to a few pages, each great thinker's death is examined in an enlightening and entertaining manner as the author waxes on the often brutal (and odd) ways they left this mortal coil. And along with natural causes, murders, and suicides, you'll discover what dark departures from suffocating in cow dung, indigestion, and lethal insect stings have to do with how we live today. At times the "sobering power of the philosophical death" might seem more like a morbidly ironic punchline to the life each philosopher led, but Critchley writes, "My hope is that, if read from beginning to end, a cumulative series of themes will emerge that will add up to a specific argument about how philosophy might teach one how to die, and by implication, how to live." <i>--Brad Thomas Parsons</i><p>Simon Critchley is Hans Jonas Professor of Philosophy at the New School for Social Research. His many books include&nbsp;<i>Very Little . . . Almost Nothing, The Faith of the Faithless</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Book of Dead Philosophers</i>.

In America's westward expansion, labor unrest, newly powerful cities, and newly mechanized industries, the ideals and ideas by which Americans lived were reshaped, and American society became more structured, with an entrenched middle class and a powerful business elite. Here, in an updated edition which includes a new introduction and a revised bibliographical essay, is a brilliant, essential work on the origins of America's corporate culture and the formation of the American social fabric after the Civil War.</p></p><p><b>Alan Trachtenberg </b>is the Neil Gray Jr. Professor Emeritus of English and American studies at Yale University, where he taught for thirty-five years. His books include <i>Shades of Hiawatha </i>(H&amp;W, 2004).<p>&#x201c;<i>The Incorporation of America</i> is one of those historical essays that not only illuminate their particular subject matter--in this case, American culture and society in the last half of the nineteenth century--but deepen our understanding of how we might think about the general question of 'culture' itself.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Warren I. Susman, Rutgers University</i></p><p>&#x201c;This book realizes an ideal often mentioned as the goal of American Studies but seldom achieved: it is a truly 'interdisciplinary' account of American culture at a turning point in our history.

Reading is a pleasure, not a duty.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Henry Nash Smith, University of California at Berkeley</i></p><p>&#x201c;This graceful venture in cultural history provides a fresh and stimulating interpretation of American society during the last decades of the nineteenth century.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>John M.

Brooks&nbsp;was born in Rome, New York on January 9, 1886, and died in Roxbury, New York on August 17, 1958. Brooks attended the University of Rochester and, after graduation, worked for the American Red Cross and the Woodrow Wilson Foundation. He became associate editor of Outlook in 1928 and subsequently was a staff writer for several magazines, including The New Yorker. The short stories he began writing at this time were published in The Saturday Evening Post, Atlantic Monthly, and Esquire. Brooks's short story "Ed Takes the Pledge" was the basis for the 1950s television series Mr. Ed, but his most lasting achievement is the Freddy the Pig series, which began in 1928 with To and Again (Freddy Goes to Florida). He subsequently wrote twenty-five more delightful books starring "that charming ingenious pig" (The New York Times), all of which are now available from The Overlook Press.&#x201c;Freddy&#x2019;s readers have called him a porcine prince . . .

Reprint.</p><p><p><strong>David Weber</strong> is author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Honor Harrington series as well as other popular novels, including some based on his <em>Starfire </em>science fiction strategy game. He lives in South Carolina with his wife and their three children.</p>In this admirable continuation of the authors' March Upcountry (2001), Prince Roger McClintock and his diminishing band of Royal Marines are still on the soggy, hot planet Marduk and still having an interesting time. Their way to the sea and their ultimate goal is barred not only by jungle, swamp, weird wildlife and local politics, but also by a wandering barbarian horde known as the Boman. In addition, the Marines' technological advantage is shrinking faster than their numbers, their vitamins may run out before they reach safety and the course of true or any other love for the prince and female sergeant Nimashet Despreaux is not running smoothly. However, human and Mardukan are able to combine resources including the engineering skills of the city of Diaspra, the wealth of the port city of K'Vaern's Cove, and the military talents of Marine Captain Pahner, exiled Mardukan prince Raster and formidable general Bistem Kar to generate both weaponry and tactics to defeat the Boman. The development of a Mardukan combined-arms force will fascinate sophisticated readers (the manual of arms for a four-armed, 10-foot soldier is a thing of beauty), while the overthrow of the Boman will grip straightforward action lovers in spite of the staggering body count. And there's the distinct hint of at least one more volume about Prince Roger's homeward journey at the end of this one, a hint that will please many.

Lewis Lockwood sketches the turbulent personal, historical, political, and cultural frameworks in which Beethoven worked and examines their effects on his music. "The result is that rarest of achievements, a profoundly humane work of scholarship that will&#x2015;or at least should&#x2015;appeal to specialists and generalists in equal measure" (Terry Teachout, <em>Commentary</em>). Finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.&nbsp; "Lewis Lockwood has written a biography of Beethoven in which the hours that Beethoven spent writing music&#x2015;that is, his methods of working, his interest in contemporary and past composers, the development of his musical intentions and ideals, his inner musical life, in short&#x2015;have been properly integrated with the external events of his career. The book is invaluable." &#x2015;Charles Rosen "Lockwood writes with poetry and clarity&#x2015;a rare combination. I especially enjoyed the connection that he makes between the works of Beethoven and the social and political context of their creation&#x2015;we feel closer to Beethoven the man without losing our wonder at his genius." &#x2015;Emanuel Ax "The magnum opus of an illustrious Beethoven scholar. From now on, we will all turn to Lockwood's <em>Beethoven: The Music and the Life</em> for insight and instruction." &#x2015;Maynard Solomon "This is truly the Beethoven biography for the intelligent reader. Lewis Lockwood speaks in his preface of writing on Beethoven's works at 'a highly accessible descriptive level.' But he goes beyond that. His discussion of the music, based on a deep knowledge of its context and the composition processes behind it, explains, elucidates, and is not afraid to evaluate; while the biographical chapters, clearly and unfussily written, and taking full account of the newest thinking on Beethoven, align closely with the musical discussion. The result is a deeply perceptive book that comes as close as can be to presenting the man and the music as a unity."&#x2015;Stanley Sadie, editor, <em>The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</em> "Impressive for both its scholarship and its fresh insights, this landmark work&#x2015;fully accessible to the interested amateur&#x2015;immediately takes its place among the essential references on this composer and his music."&#x2015;Bob Goldfarb, KUSC-FM 91.5 "Lockwood writes like an angel: lucid, enthusiastic, stirring and enlightening. Beethoven has found his ablest interpreter."&#x2015;Jonathan Keates, <em>The Spectator</em>&nbsp; "There is no better survey of Beethoven's compositions for a wide audience."&#x2015;Michael Kimmelman, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em> 50 illustrations</p><p>Lewis Lockwood taught at Princeton and Harvard universities, where he is Fanny Peabody Professor of Music Emeritus. His Beethoven: The Music and the Life was a Pulitzer Prize finalist. He resides in Brookline, Massachusetts.Although he breaks no new ground, Lockwood (a Harvard professor emeritus in music and a leading Beethoven scholar) does offer an extremely cogent account of the works as they relate to the well-known three phases of Beethoven's remarkable creative life. It's appropriate that the title places the music first, because it is Lockwood's highly observant account of the composer's musical development that will strike readers most forcibly. There is nothing much new to say about the life, and here Lockwood only goes through the motions, pausing only to observe that despite all the speculation, it is doubtful that Beethoven ever enjoyed the physical love of a woman, notwithstanding his many infatuations and sometimes passionate letters. On the music, however, he has many fine insights, particularly into Beethoven's very conscious and determined development of his skills, and his often-neglected splendor as a melodist. A regular Beethoven listener could do worse than use Lockwood's accounts of the works, particularly the middle and late ones-he's inclined to give scant shrift to anything before the Opus 18 quartets-as concert or record notes, written at exactly the right pitch for knowledgeable music lovers who don't have a score in front of them. Lockwood is also thorough regarding the impact of such previous masters as Handel, Bach, Mozart and Haydn on Beethoven's art.

This is the first book in English to offer a representative selection of writings from all of her amazing range of work. <br><br> Hildegard wrote many volumes on subjects from mystical vision to sexuality, from theology to natural medicine&#x2014;in letters, treatises, poetry, and songs&#x2014;all in an age when few women wrote more than an occasional letter. She was a woman of extraordinary influence whose work not only surpassed that of her male contemporaries in its range, but also outshone them in visionary beauty and intellectual power. This collection includes a brief biography of Hildegard, and selections from the following works: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; <i>Scivias</i> (literally, "know the ways"), the record of Hildegard's visions and her commentary on them <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; <i>The Book of Life's Merits, </i> visionary work <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; <i>The Book of Divine Works, </i> a work of cosmology and anthropology <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; <i>Natural History, </i> a record of plants, animals, and minerals, translated here into English for the first time <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; <i>Causes and Cures, </i> a compendium of her writing on natural medicine <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; <i>Symphonia,</i> her songs and poetry <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Biographical works <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Selected letters</p><p><b>Hildegard of Bingen&nbsp;</b>was a German Benedictine abbess, composer, philosopher, mystic, visionary, and extremely gifted polymath.

James E. Wilson uses his training as a geologist and his years of research in the wine regions of France to fully examine the concept of terroir. The result combines natural history, social history, and scientific study, making this a unique book that all wine connoisseurs and professionals will want close at hand. In Part One Wilson introduces the full range of environmental factors that together form terroir. He explains France&#39;s geological foundation; its soil, considered the &#34;soul&#34; of a vineyard; the various climates and microclimates; the vines, their history and how each type has evolved; and the role that humans--from ancient monks to modern enologists--have played in viticulture. Part Two examines the history and habitat of each of France&#39;s major wine regions. Wilson explores the question of why one site yields great wines while an adjacent site yields wines of lesser quality. He also looks at cultural influences such as migration and trade and at the adaptations made by centuries of vignerons to produce distinctive wine styles. Wilson skillfully presents both technical information and personal anecdotes, and the book&#39;s photographs, maps, and geologic renderings are extremely helpful. The appendices contain a glossary and information on the labeling of French wines. With a wealth of information explained in clear English, Wilson&#39;s book enables wine readers to understand and appreciate the mystique of terroir.</p><p>James E. Wilson is a former Vice President for Exploration and Production at Shell Oil. In his second career he has devoted himself to the study of the natural history and underlying geology of French wines. He lives in Colorado.

Dick</p><p>"One of the most important scientific philosophers of his century--scholarly, witty, scientific, hip and hopeful."<br>--Dr. Timothy Leary</p></blockquote></p><p>Robert Anton Wilson is the grand pooh-bah of late-20th-century conspiracy theory, but regular Wilson fans may find <i>Everything Is Under Control</i> inchoate in comparison to such masterworks as the Illuminatus! trilogy. The format may be encyclopedic, but the information isn't; to note one glaring omission, the only entries on Ronald Reagan refer readers to three other entries in which Reagan is briefly mentioned--none of which has anything to do with Iran-Contra. (Actually, there is a listing for Iran-Contra, but again, it merely points to <i>some</i> of the pieces of the puzzle.)<p> The book's primary value, then, apart from the snippets of conspiracy "proof" it does provide, is in Wilson's playful yet insightful articulation of the psychology and linguistics of conspiratorial thinking. "Because we can say 'the Jews' or 'the New World Order' or 'the Patriarchy,'" he writes, "we can believe, or almost believe, that these grammatical abstractions have the same kind of reality as basketballs, barking dogs, and baked beans." There are also some fun private jokes, including a lot of data on the Discordians. It's not the best Wilson book--that, perhaps, is <i>Masks of the Illuminati</i>--but it's an adequate introduction to his imaginative philosophy. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>Robert Anton Wilson has authored more than 30 books, teaches at Esalen, Oasis, Interface, and Open Center, maintains an award-winning website, and has been a guest artist on a punk rock record with Golden Horde.</p><h2>Regarding the Fountain: A Tale, in Letters, of Liars and Leaks (Regarding the...(Hardcover))</h2><p>The Dry Creek Middle School drinking fountain has sprung a leak, so principal Walter Russ dashes off a request to Flowing Waters Fountains, Etc. asking<p> "...We need a new drinking fountain. Please send catalog. "</p><p>Florence Waters responds:</p><p>"I'd be delighted. . .

So is her friend, Dee Eel, of the water-supply company. A scandal is brewing, and the fifth-grade class is researching Dry Creek's history. Something very fishy is going on...and the secrets are buried beneath the fountain and within this delightful, thoroughly original novel.</p></p><p>How could a simple request for a new water fountain go so very, very off-track? When Principal Wally Russ writes to fountain designer Florence Waters to ask her to replace Dry Creek Middle School's busted drinking fountain, he little suspects that he is sparking the imagination of an <i>artiste</i>. Kate Klise's charming mystery novel is told entirely in letters and faxes, as the glamorous Florence visits Dry Creek and becomes friends with Mr. Sam N.'s fifth-grade class. The class helps Florence design the most outrageous water fountain ever, and along the way uncovers the dirty (and rather wet) secret that dwells underneath Dry Creek Middle School. Writes Florence to her new fifth-grade friends, "Your drawings are hanging in my studio. Pure inspiration. Of course a drinking fountain should have tropical fish and chocolate shakes!" The book reads like an inspired combination of the epistolary novels <i>Daddy-Long-Legs</i> and <i>Griffin &amp; Sabine</i>. Line drawings by M. Sarah Klise adorn every page, with "snapshots" of the fifth-grade class, pages from the local paper, and coffee-stained While You Were Out notices thickening the stew. The emphasis on visual elements should make the book a hit with kids who claim they don't like to read. Author Klise knows her audience: bad puns flow as freely as water and the plot is just convoluted enough to challenge kids without frustrating them. The Klise sisters have created a classic of comic children's literature.

In this groundbreaking book, he presents a new approach to understanding and changing couples: a fundamental social skill called &#x201c;emotional attunement,&#x201d; which describes a couple&#x2019;s ability to fully process and move on from negative emotional events, ultimately creating a stronger relationship.</p><p></p><p>Gottman draws from this longitudinal research and theory to show how emotional attunement can downregulate negative affect, help couples focus on positive traits and memories, and even help prevent domestic violence. He offers a detailed intervention devised to cultivate attunement, thereby helping couples connect, respect each other, and show affection. Emotional attunement is extended to tackle the subjects of flooding, the story we tell ourselves about our relationship, conflict, personality, changing relationships, and gender. Gottman also explains how to create emotional attunement when it is missing, to lay a foundation that will carry the relationship through difficult times.</p><p></p><p>Gottman encourages couples to cultivate attunement through awareness, tolerance, understanding, non-defensive listening, and empathy. These qualities, he argues, inspire confidence in couples, and the sense that despite the inevitable struggles, the relationship is enduring and resilient.</p><p></p><p>This audiobook, an essential follow-up to his 1999 <i>The Marriage Clinic</i>, offers therapists, students, and researchers a detailed intervention for working with couples, and offers couples a roadmap to a stronger future together.</p><p></p></p><p><p>World renowned for his work on marital stability and divorce prediction, John Gottman has conducted 40 years of breakthrough research with thousands of couples.&nbsp;Co-founder of the Gottman Institute with his wife,&nbsp;Dr. Julie Schwartz Gottman, John was also the Executive Director of the Relationship Research Institute.

This is because the author � who has been an initiated High Priestess for almost three decades � knows how to present the information in a way that stirs the blood and makes Witchcraft a powerful system that you'll want to practice. Look at what the author has to say about visualization: <br> <br>"Proficiency at visualization is most important to all occult training. I have encountered only one or two people in all the years that I have been teaching who were unable to visualize. However, they had the ability to conceptualize with similarly accurate results... <br> <br>"Without the ability to visualize, projecting into the astral realms is almost impossible (at least consciously...). The ability to visualize is integral to spellcrafting and can lead to dramatic changes and accomplishments..." <br> <br>This makes it very clear that visualization is vitally important in all aspects of the occult and, more important, that you can do it! She goes on to give five exercises to bring your visualization abilities to a high level. <br> <br>This is continued throughout the book: information you can use, encouragement for inevitable success, and numerous magical and spiritual practices and techniques. Combine that with a complete explanation of the festivals of Witchcraft, how to do rituals, use the spells, perform a self-initiation, contact the God and the Goddess, and you have one of the most important books on Witchcraft ever! <br> <br>Get your copy today. <br>A witch, like the Earth, can be both immeasurably ancient and forever young<p>A witch realizes certain powers...represents, rather than worships them...invokes them; fuses with them, emotes and lives them; recognizes them in the vast forces of nature and beyond.</p><p>This comprehensive manual sets forth the tenets of Witchcraft, and explains in depth why and how magic works. It includes tried and true methods for developing the magical will, along with religious training, ritual observances, and spellcrafting techniques. Witchcraft: Theory and Practice also: <br>-- Describes unique practices such as fith-fathing, fetching, shapeshifting, and glamouring<br>-- Tells how to identify and interpret omens and portents<br>-- Includes instructions on astral travel, cleansings, banishings, and how to make something invisible<br>-- Offers a guided ritual for self-initiation</p><p>All things come full circle -- reclaim the ancient power that sings within your blood through sacred ritual to the Earth and Moon and Sun and Stars.</p></p><h2>Texas Tomboy</h2><p><b>The entire ranch is thirsty&#x2014;will the rains ever come?<br><br></b>Tomboy Charlie loves the ranch and the outdoors, especially now that she has a horse of her own and can ride like a true cowboy.

Unlike many writers of the period, however, Bannon broke through the shame and isolation typically portrayed in lesbian pulps, offering instead women characters who embrace their sexuality against great odds.</p><p>With Beebo Brinker, Bannon introduces the title character, a butch 17-year-old farm girl newly arrived in New York after she is driven from her Wisconsin home town for wearing drag to the State Fair. Befriended by the gay Jack Mann, a father-figure with a weakness for runaways, Beebo sets out to find love. She never knew what she wanted&#x2014;until she came to Greenwich Village and found the love that smolders in the shadows of the twilight world.</p><p>Overwhelmed with her discovery, Beebo is infatuated in turn with the vixen Mona Petry, the sweet femme Paula Ash, and the famous actress Venus Bogardus. Sexy, dangerous, and often touching, Beebo Brinker's search for love takes her from password-protected 1950s lesbian bars to the glamour and ritz of Hollywood and back. Chronicling the reality of 1950s lesbian life through Ann Bannon's dreamy butch, Beebo Brinker is an astounding and engaging read.</p></p><p>When housewife Ann Bannon brought her first novel to a paperback publisher in the mid-1950s, the publisher skimmed the manuscript and told her to scrap everything but the college love affair between two women. "There's your real story," he said as she blushed, ashamed that her secret obsession had been so obvious to him. The resulting novel was <i>Odd Girl Out</i>, one of the bestselling paperbacks of the period, and perhaps the best (and least depressing) example of lesbian pulp fiction, a genre that flourished from the end of the Second World War until the changing laws on censorship made much seamier material commonplace, and the growing gay rights movement brought the gay life out of the shadows. Although the last of a four-book series, <i>Beebo Brinker</i> introduces Bannon's central character, a young, handsome butch who arrives in New York scared and innocent (and wearing a <i>dress</i>) but soon has the femmes of Greenwich Village in the palm of her hand. Essential reading for anyone interesting in lesbian herstory; a period piece (and a welcome reprint) that has worn remarkably well.<i>--Regina Marler</i>Ann Bannon is the author of the classic lesbian pulp novels Odd Girl Out (forthcoming from Cleis Press, October 2001), Women in the Shadows (1959), I Am a Woman (1959) Journey to a Woman (1960), The Marriage (1960) and Beebo Brinker (1962). <p>Taking a pseudonym in the interest of privacy, Bannon wrote her first book, Odd Girl Out, as a coming of age novel that involved love between college sorority sisters. When an editor singled-out the school-girl romance as her story's most compelling feature, the book was re-written for a lesbian pulp fiction audience. Unlike most pulps, however, Bannon broke with tradition by avoiding sensationalistic plots in favor of emotionally engaged character development. </p><p>Despite her now legendary status among lesbian and gay readers, she surprisingly had no "emotional or intellectual connection" to lesbianism prior to the publication of her first book. "My story is a strange one, with all the apparent conventionality," Bannon recalls. "Everyone in my daily life thought I was just a very nice, young conventional wife and mother. They really didn't know what was going on in my head or my emotions and that was sort of how I got away with it." </p><p>Odd Girl Out enjoyed tremendous success, inspiring other ground-breaking works, most notably Beebo Brinker. Her sensitive renderings of sexuality also won Bannon a devoted following among isolated lesbians everywhere. "I got nice letters from a lot of really lovely women, and women who were hurting a lot, and women all over the country," Bannon remarks. "So many saying, 'Thank God I finally got connected with somebody who really knows what this is about.' " </p><p>The character of Beebo is among the most-loved lesbians ever to appear in gay and lesbian fiction. "I never met Beebo in the flesh, but she was part of my daydreams from a very early time," Bannon says of her ultra-butch protagonist. Although Beebo Brinker is Bannon's last published novel, the events in the story actually occur before those of Odd Girl Out. Thus the book is the first in the new Lesbian Pulp Fiction series, a line of lesbian pulps from Cleis Press that offer rare, first-hand looks into the pre-Stonewall era. As one reviewer observes, "Aside from being light, fun reading, the Beebo Brinker series gives us a glimpse of our past, along with a sense of where we came from and how far we've gotten."</p></p><h2>Taoism: The Parting of the Way</h2><p>Called "a first-rate piece of work" by T.

Some titles tell the tale: <i>Cosmos and Transcendence: Breaking Through the Barrier of Scientistic Belief</i>; <i>The Quantum Enigma: Finding the Hidden Key</i>; <i>Ancient Wisdom and Modern Misconceptions: A Critique of Contemporary Scientism</i>; <i>Science and Myth: With a Response to Stephen Hawking's</i> The Grand Design; and <i>Rediscovering the Integral Cosmos: Physics, Metaphysics, and Vertical Causality.</i><br><i></i><br> The present book, which appeared in an earlier version as Part I of the last-named, includes arresting new material on the metaphysics of the integral cosmos. Smith accomplishes a magnificent re-integration of the physical sciences into a worldview banished in the West since the Enlightenment yet perfectly accommodative of every legitimate discovery of science. So far from constituting a kind of academic, or nostalgic curiosity, however, that long-forgotten worldview proves to be <i>precisely</i> what is needed to resolve the quandary of the so-called quantum paradox, which has stymied theoretical physicists since the year 1927! The implications of this text, which re-evaluates Einstein's relativism as well as epistemologies falsely based on the Galilean/Cartesian notion of "secondary qualities," restores the ontological realism of the world as we behold it, and&nbsp;opens hitherto inconceivable venues for scientific inquiry. The epochal implications of Smith's work will be brought to light for an expanded audience in a full-length documentary film on his life and thought, <i>The End of Quantum Reality</i>, scheduled for release in early 2019. "One has, in the evening of one's life, the luxury to speak freely," Smith writes, and as never before, so he does.</p><p>"This short but remarkably rich work of Wolfgang Smith is a&nbsp;<i>tour de force</i>, summarizing and synthesizing the seminal texts he has written over the past few decades. May this book receive the global attention it deserves."--<b>SEYYED HOSSEIN NASR</b><br><b></b><br>"The reader of the present book can expect no less than a study that promises--like its medieval counterparts which opened up the way to present-day mathematical physics--to bear fruit for centuries to come."--<b>RAPHAEL D.M. DE PAOLA</b><br><b></b><br>"Prof. Smith's metaphysical reading of the cosmic icon by way of its Euclidean construction is on a par with Ren� Gu�non's mathematico-metaphysical texts. It even surpasses these in two ways: first, by enabling us to literally see what falsifies the Einsteinian conception of 'space-time'; and second, by empowering us to comprehend the cosmological teachings concealed in both the Old and New Testaments through the rediscovery of the cosmic trichotomy."--<b>BRUNO B�RARD</b><br><b></b><br>"The importance of this book by physicist and metaphysician Wolfgang Smith lies in the very reasons that will no doubt make it controversial: it challenges certain fundamental features of modern science, namely its epistemological assumptions, its reductive methodologies, and its ideological premises."--<b>M. ALI LAKHANI</b><br><b></b><br>"Professor Smith's latest manuscript, taken together with his earlier work, presents a traditional and ontological interpretation of physics with uncommon quality and competence."--<b>ALI SEBETCI</b>Wolfgang Smith was born in Vienna in 1930. At age eighteen he graduated from Cornell University with majors in physics, mathematics, and philosophy. At age twenty he received his Master's degree in theoretical physics from Purdue University, and climbed the Matterhorn.<br><br>After contributing to the theoretical solution of the re-entry problem as an aerodynamicist at Bell Aircraft Corporation, Smith earned his doctorate in Mathematics at Columbia University, subsequently embarking upon a 30-year career as a Professor of Mathematics at MIT, UCLA, and Oregon State University.<br><br>Despite his impeccable credentials in physics, mathematics, and philosophy, Wolfgang Smith is at heart an outsider not only in regard to these academic disciplines, but more profoundly, in reference to the post-Enlightenment premises of our contemporary world.&nbsp;Finding himself, thus, irreconcilably at odds with the prevailing Zeitgeist, Smith decided to forego a professional career in the fields of his primary interest--i.e., physics and philosophy--in favor of pure mathematics: the one and only academic discipline, he avers, in which "political correctness" can find no foothold. And so he enjoyed the luxury of pursuing a respected university career while being at liberty, as he puts it, "to remain perfectly sane."<br><br>It is no wonder, then, that when he finally confronted the so-called quantum enigma, Smith perceived the issue in a very different light than his peers. The problem all along had actually not been "technical"! It was not a question to be resolved by way of differential equations, nor primarily a matter of finding something new--but one of jettisoning an entire Weltanschauung. And for Wolfgang Smith this posed no difficulty: he had in fact done so decades earlier, as can be discerned in his remarkable series of publications.<br><br>Wolfgang Smith's life and work are the subject of the documentary film <i>The End of Quantum Reality</i>, scheduled for release in early 2019.</p><h2>The Feeling of Life Itself: Why Consciousness Is Widespread but Can&#39;t Be Computed (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>An argument that consciousness, more widespread than previously assumed, is the feeling of being alive, not a type of computation or a clever hack.</b></p><p>In <i>The Feeling of Life Itself</i>, Christof Koch offers a straightforward definition of consciousness as any subjective experience, from the most mundane to the most exalted&#x2015;the feeling of being alive.&nbsp;</p><p>Psychologists study which cognitive operations underpin a given conscious perception. Neuroscientists track the neural correlates of consciousness in the brain, the organ of the mind. But why the brain and not, say, the liver? How can the brain, three pounds of highly excitable matter, a piece of furniture in the universe, subject to the same laws of physics as any other piece, give rise to subjective experience? Koch argues that what is needed to answer these questions is a quantitative theory that starts with experience and proceeds to the brain. In <i>The Feeling of Life Itself</i>, Koch outlines such a theory, based on integrated information.</p><p>Koch describes how the theory explains many facts about the neurology of consciousness and how it has been used to build a clinically useful consciousness meter. The theory predicts that many, and perhaps all, animals experience the sights and sounds of life; consciousness is much more widespread than conventionally assumed. Contrary to received wisdom, however, Koch argues that programmable computers will not have consciousness. Even a perfect software model of the brain is not conscious. Its simulation is fake consciousness. Consciousness is not a special type of computation&#x2015;it is not a clever hack. Consciousness is about being.<br></p></p><p>Christof Koch is President and Chief Scientist of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, following twenty-seven years as a Professor at the California Institute of Technology.

Accepting the increasingly widespread belief that industrialized culture inevitably erodes the natural world, Endgame sets out to explore how this relationship impels us towards a revolutionary and as-yet undiscovered shift in strategy. Building on a series of simple but increasingly provocative premises, Jensen leaves us hoping for what may be inevitable: a return to agrarian communal life via the disintegration of civilization itself.</p><p>Activist, philosopher, teacher, and leading voice of uncompromising dissent, DERRICK JENSEN holds degrees in creative writing and mineral engineering physics. In 2008, he was named one of the&nbsp;<i>Utne Reader</i>&#x2019;s "50 Visionaries Who Are Changing Your World," and in 2006 he was named Press Action&#x2019;s Person of the Year for his work on&nbsp;<i>Endgame</i>. He lives in California.The author, who in earlier books like <i>The Culture of Make Believe </i>discussed his experience of violence and abuse as a child, calls now for determined and even violent resistance to environmental degradation. Jensen comes across in volume I as a provocative but personable philosopher-activist who in lyrical and witty writing bemoans species extinction, sullied air quality, shrinking icecaps, expanding deserts and vanishing forests wrought by humans. But Jensen believes "this culture will not undergo any sort of voluntary transformation to a sane and sustainable way of living." Civilization, he says in volume II, is killing the planet, so "[c]ivilization needs to be brought down now." Jensen dwells through several chapters on the need to destroy tens of thousands of river dams, whether with pickax-wielding citizen armies or through the use of well-placed explosive charges; other chapters consider how simple it would be to paralyze the American capitalist system if small activist cells were to disrupt railway, highway, pipeline and other elements of commercial infrastructure. Jensen clearly feels a close connection to nature, writes movingly about the hoped-for return of the salmon, the trees, the grizzly bears. But he has become so disgusted with what he calls "civiluzation" that he has more compassion for the salmon than for his fellow humans.<i> (June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The longsuffering Bertie, on the cusp of his seventh birthday party, has taken to dreaming about his eighteenth, a time when he will be able to avoid the indignity of unwanted girl attendees and the looming threat of a gender-neutral doll from his domineering mother Irene. Matthew and Elspeth struggle to care for their triplets, contending with Danish au pairs and dubious dukes to boot, while the narcissistic Bruce faces his greatest challenge yet in the form of an over-eager waxologist. As ever, when Alexander McCall Smith visits 44 Scotland Street, fun is sure to follow.</p><p><b>ALEXANDER McCALL SMITH&nbsp;</b>is the author of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, the Isabel Dalhousie series, the Portuguese Irregular Verbs series, the 44 Scotland Street series, and the Corduroy Mansions series. He is professor emeritus of medical law at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and has served with many national and international organizations concerned with bioethics. He was born in what is now known as Zimbabwe and was a law professor at the University of Botswana. He lives in Scotland.&nbsp;Visit his website at&nbsp;www.alexandermccallsmith.com.1. Knives and Chromosomes <br><br>Bertie Pollock (6) was the son of Irene Pollock (37) and Stuart Pollock (40), and older brother of Ulysses Colquhoun Pollock (1). Ulysses was also the son of Irene but possibly not of Stuart, the small boy bearing a remarkable resemblance to Bertie&#x2019;s psychotherapist, recently self-removed from Edinburgh to a university chair in Aberdeen. Stuart, too, had been promoted, having recently been moved up three rungs on the civil service ladder after incurring the gratitude of a government minister. This had happened after Stuart, in a moment of sheer frustration, had submitted the numbers from The Scotsman&#x2019;s Sudoku puzzle to the minister, representing them as likely North Sea oil production volumes. He had immediately felt guilty about this adolescent gesture&#x2014;homo ludens, playful man, might be appreciated in the arts but not in the civil service&#x2014;and had he been able to retract the figures he would have done so. But it was too late; the minister was delighted with the encouraging projection, with the result that any confession by Stuart would have been a career-terminating event. So he remained silent, and was immensely relieved to discover later that the real figures, once unearthed, were so close to his Sudoku numbers as to make no difference. His conscience was saved by coincidence, but never again, he said to himself.<br><br>Irene had no interest in statistics and always adopted a glazed expression at any mention of the subject. &#x201c;I can accept that what you do is very important, Stuart,&#x201d; she said, in a pinched, rather pained tone, &#x201c;but frankly it leaves me cold. No offence, of course.&#x201d;<br><br>Her own interests were focused on psychology&#x2014;she had a keen interest in the writings of Melanie Klein&#x2014;and the raising of children. Bertie&#x2019;s education, in particular, was a matter of great concern to her, and she had already written an article for the journal Progressive Motherhood, in which she had set out the objectives of what she described as &#x201c;the Bertie Project.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The emphasis,&#x201d; she wrote, &#x201c;must always be on the flourishing of the child&#x2019;s own personality. Yet this overriding goal is not incompatible with the provision of a programme of interest-enhancement in the child herself&#x201d; (Irene was not one to use the male pronoun when a feminine form existed). &#x201c;In the case of Bertie, I constructed a broad and fulfilling programme of intellectual stimulation introducing him at a very early stage (four months) to the possibilities of theatre, music and the plastic arts. The inability of the very small infant to articulate a response to the theatre, for example, is not an indication of lack of appreciation&#x2014;far from it, in fact. Bertie was at the age of four months taken to a performance by the Contemporary Theatre of Krakow at the Edinburgh Festival and reacted very positively to the rapid changes of light on the stage. There are many other examples. His response to Klee, for instance, was noticeable when he was barely three, and by the age of four he was quite capable of distinguishing Peploe from Matisse.&#x201d;<br><br>Some of these claims had some truth to them. Bertie was, in fact, extremely talented, and had read way beyond what one might expect to find in a six-year-old. Most six-year-olds, if they can read at all, are restricted to the doings of Spot the Dog and other relatively unsubtle characters; Bertie, by contrast, had already consumed not only the complete works of Roald Dahl for children, but also half of Norman Lebrecht&#x2019;s book on Mahler and almost seventy pages of Miranda Car�ter&#x2019;s biography of the late Anthony Blunt. His choice of this reading, which was prodigious on any view, was dependent on what he happened to find lying about on his parents&#x2019; bookshelves, and this was, of course, the reason why he had also dipped into several volumes of Melanie Klein and was acquainted too with a number of Freud&#x2019;s accounts of his famous cases, especially those of Little Hans and the Wolf Man.<br><br>Little Hans struck Bertie as being an entirely reasonable boy, who had just as little need of analysis as he himself had.<br><br>&#x201c;I think Dr. Freud shouldn&#x2019;t have worried about that boy Hans,&#x201d; Bertie remarked to his mother, as they made their way one afternoon to the consulting rooms of Bertie&#x2019;s psychotherapist in Queen Street. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think there was anything wrong with him, Mummy, I really don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a matter of opinion, Bertie,&#x201d; answered Irene. &#x201c;And actually it&#x2019;s Professor Freud, not Dr. Freud.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said Bertie. &#x201c;Professor Freud then. Why does he keep going on about . . .&#x201d; He lowered his voice, and then became silent.<br><br>&#x201c;About what, Bertie?&#x201d; asked Irene. &#x201c;What do you think Professor Freud goes on about?&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie slowed his pace. He was looking down at the ground with studious intensity. &#x201c;About bo . . .&#x201d; he half-whispered. Modesty prevented his completing the sentence.<br><br>&#x201c;About what, Bertie?&#x201d; prompted Irene. &#x201c;We mustn&#x2019;t mumble, carissimo. We must speak clearly so that others can understand what we have to say.&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie looked anxiously about him. He decided to change the subject. &#x201c;What about my birthday, Mummy?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Irene looked down at her son. &#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s coming up very soon, Bertie. Next week, in fact. Are you excited?&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie nodded. He had waited so long for this birthday&#x2014;his seventh&#x2014;that he found it difficult to believe that it was now about to arrive. It seemed to him that it had been years since the last one, and he had almost given up on the thought of turning seven, let alone eighteen, which he knew was the age at which one could leave one&#x2019;s mother. That was the real goal&#x2014;a distant, impossibly exciting, shimmering objective. Freedom.<br><br>&#x201c;Will I get any presents?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>Irene smiled. &#x201c;Of course you will, Bertie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like a Swiss Army penknife,&#x201d; he half-whispered. &#x201c;Or a fishing rod.&#x201d;<br><br>Irene said nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;Other boys have these things,&#x201d; Bertie pleaded.<br><br>Irene pursed her lips. &#x201c;Other boys? Do you mean Tofu?&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie nodded miserably.<br><br>&#x201c;Well the less said about him the better,&#x201d; said Irene. She sighed. Why did men&#x2014;and little boys too&#x2014;have to hanker after weapons when they already had their . . . She shook her head in exasperation. What was the point of all this effort if, after years of striving to protect Bertie from gender stereotypes, he came up with a request for a knife? It was a question of the number of chromosomes, she thought: therein lay the core of the problem.<br><br>2. Essex Girls et al<br><br>From Bertie&#x2019;s point of view his approaching birthday was the cause of immense excitement. Not only was there the issue of presents&#x2014;although he was virtually reconciled to not getting what he wanted, as his mother had on previous birthdays always been careful to choose gender-neutral gifts&#x2014;there was also the question of the party Irene had promised him. This was something to which Bertie looked forward with keen anticipation, although he knew that here, too, there would be snares and pitfalls that would require very careful evasive action on his part.<br><br>The greatest problem, of course, was the list of those to be invited. If Bertie had his way, the guests would all be boys, as that would mean that they would be able to play the games they wanted without having to take into account the wishes of any girls. Bertie had once been to a party where the guests had played British Bulldog, and he had enjoyed that every bit as much as that other game of rough and tumble, Chase the Dentist. Girls, he had learned, liked neither of these games, on the grounds that the boys, being rougher and more inclined to push and shove, had a natural advantage over them.<br><br>But the list, he knew, could not be an all-boy one, as Irene had made it very clear that she expected an equal number of boy and girl guests.<br><br>&#x201c;There are plenty of nice girls who&#x2019;d love to come to your party, Bertie,&#x201d; she assured him. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s Olive, obviously, and Olive&#x2019;s friend Pansy. Then there&#x2019;s that pleasant girl Chardonnay, although heaven knows why her parents should saddle her with such a name . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It sounds rather nice,&#x201d; said Bertie. &#x201c;I think she likes it. And she&#x2019;s got a little sister called Shiraz. That&#x2019;s a nice name too, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>Irene rolled her eyes upwards. &#x201c;Such names are . . . well, they&#x2019;re rather closely linked with . . . well, Bertie, I&#x2019;m sorry to say they are rather closely associated with Essex.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Essex?&#x201d; said Bertie. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t Essex a place in England, Mummy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes it is,&#x201d; said Irene. &#x201c;Unfortunately.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean, Mummy? Are there lots of girls called Chardonnay in Essex, but not in Edinburgh?&#x201d;<br><br>Irene suppressed a smile. &#x201c;You could say that, Bertie. Chardonnay is not really an Edinburgh name. But Essex, you see, is a bit . . . It&#x2019;s a bit . . . well, let&#x2019;s not worry about Essex, Bertie. Chardonnay can&#x2019;t help her unfortunate name, and I&#x2019;m sure that she&#x2019;ll love to come to your party.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And there&#x2019;ll be boys too,&#x201d; said Bertie quickly.<br><br>Irene nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure that Ranald will be very happy to come.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And Tofu.&#x201d;<br><br>Irene made a non-committal noise. &#x201c;I thought you found Tofu a bit difficult, Bertie.&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie nodded. &#x201c;Yes, he is, Mummy. But I have to invite him. He&#x2019;d hear about the party and if I didn&#x2019;t invite him, there&#x2019;d be trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>The conversation about guests continued for some time, but Bertie&#x2019;s mind was not really on it. He was now remembering the party he had attended several weeks earlier, which had been to celebrate Olive&#x2019;s seventh birthday. Bertie had been reluctant to go to this but had been obliged by his mother to accept the invitation. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll enjoy yourself once you&#x2019;re there, Bertie,&#x201d; she had said. &#x201c;I often find that myself when Mummy and Daddy have to go out. We may not be in the mood to begin with, but then we find that we enjoy ourselves quite a lot once we&#x2019;re there. Daddy often finds that.&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie thought about this. &#x201c;Is that because he gets drunk, Mummy?&#x201d;<br><br>Irene looked shocked. &#x201c;Bertie, you mustn&#x2019;t say things like that. Daddy doesn&#x2019;t get drunk at cocktail parties. Anyway, the point is this: you&#x2019;ll enjoy Olive&#x2019;s party once you&#x2019;re there&#x2014;you mark my words.&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie did not enjoy himself. When he arrived at Olive&#x2019;s house in the Braids, his heart sank as he saw the cluster of pink balloons tied to the gatepost at the end of the short drive. And it sank even further when he realised that of the twelve guests invited by Olive, he was the only boy.<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t Ranald coming?&#x201d; he asked Olive as he handed over her present.<br><br>&#x201c;Certainly not,&#x201d; said Olive. &#x201c;Ranald Braveheart Macpherson has not been invited to my house and never will be, with those stupid thin legs of his! No, Bertie, you are the only boy who is privileged to join us today, and you should be jolly grateful for that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Pansy, shaking her finger at him. &#x201c;You should know just how lucky you are, Bertie.&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie did not argue. He was outnumbered in every way, and he had long ago learned that arguing with Olive got one nowhere. So he busied himself with a sausage roll and a slice of pizza and waited for events to take their natural course.<br><br>After tea, Olive had clapped her hands and announced that it was time for games. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to play a game now,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;A really good one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Houses?&#x201d; asked Pansy. &#x201c;Could we play houses, Olive?&#x201d;<br><br>Olive appeared to give this request full consideration before she shook her head. &#x201c;No, we shall not play houses, Pansy. Houses is a very yesterday game. We&#x2019;re going to play Jane Austen!&#x201d;<br><br>There were squeals of pleasure and excitement from several of the girls. &#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; enthused Pansy. &#x201c;Jane Austen!&#x201d; And then she asked, &#x201c;How do you play that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be Lizzie,&#x201d; said Olive. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a girl with lots of sisters. Pansy, you can be her Mummy, who is very stupid, and Lakshmi, you can be her sister Jane. And Bertie . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie looked away. It was only three o&#x2019;clock and the party was due to go on until five. Two hours of Jane Austen stretched ahead of him.<br><br>&#x201c;And you, Bertie,&#x201d; said Olive decisively, &#x201c;you can be Mr. Darcy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How do I do that?&#x201d; whispered Bertie. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how to play Jane Austen, Olive.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You just stand there and be handsome,&#x201d; said Olive. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all you have to do. And when one of the sisters asks you to dance, then you have to bow and say, &#x2018;Madam, I would be most honoured, truly I would.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s all. You don&#x2019;t have to say anything else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How long do I have to do that for?&#x201d; asked Bertie.<br><br>&#x201c;An hour or so,&#x201d; said Olive. &#x201c;Then we&#x2019;re going to play another game. Royal Weddings!&#x201d;<br><br>There were further squeals of excitement, but from Bertie there came only a sigh. Royal Weddings, he felt, was a game that adults played&#x2014;not children.</p><h2>David Crockett: The Lion of the West</h2><p><p><strong>Steeped in legend, shrouded in folklore, the real David Crockett, American frontiersman and cultural icon, finally emerges in this engrossing biography.</strong></p> His name was David Crockett. He never signed his name any other way, but popular culture transformed his memory into "Davy Crockett," and Hollywood gave him a raccoon hat he hardly ever wore. Best-selling historian Michael Wallis casts a fresh look at the frontiersman, storyteller, and politician behind these legendary stories. Born into a humble Tennessee family in 1786, Crockett never "killed him a b'ar" when he was only three. But he did cut a huge swath across early-nineteenth-century America&#x2015;as a bear hunter, a frontier explorer, a soldier serving under Andrew Jackson, an unlikely congressman, and, finally, a martyr in his now-controversial death at the Alamo. Wallis's <em>David Crockett</em> is more than a riveting story. It is a revelatory, authoritative biography that separates fact from fiction, providing us with an extraordinary evocation of a true American hero and the rough-and-tumble times in which he lived. 60 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Michael Wallis, the best-selling author of Route 66 and Billy the Kid, has published eighteen books and won numerous honors and awards. He is a popular public speaker and a highly acclaimed voice actor. He lives in Tulsa, Oklahoma.Wallis examination of the man behind the myth is both well written and engrossing. "<br><br>Michael Wallis is the master frontier story teller, having chronicled everything from Billy the Kid to Highway 66. Now he s told the tale of the real David Crockett as distinguished from the mostly mythical one. Davy (with a show biz y ) Crockett did, in fact, die at The Alamo but he did not kill a bear when he was only three or wear a coonskin cap except in publicity photographs. That s just for starters. But the truth has a way of being more interesting than the made-up, most particularly when in the talented writing mind and hands of Michael Wallis. --Jim Lehrer"<br><br>Like Crockett himself [Wallis] is a storyteller. The man who emerges from these pages is vivid, comprehensible, and, in the main, historically reliable. On a subject that has come to be dominated by acrimonious debate and posturing, such serenity has a lot to recommend it.

This is the life that Deborah Smith Douglas chronicles&#x2015;and invites readers into&#x2015;in her lovely collection of essays and poems. Drawing from events as simple as breakfast with her five-year-old daughter or waiting in line at the post office, Douglas shows how a loving relationship with God can be nurtured in small ways every day. &#x201c;Without my ever really intending it,&#x201d; she writes, &#x201c;my own life&#x2015;as a wife and mother, daughter and friend&#x2015;has taught me to see God hidden in the ordinary, to watch for God under the surface of things as a fisherman watches for fish.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p> <p>Woven into each of these pieces, along with reflections on the author&#x2019;s experiences, are guidelines for readers watching for God in their own unique&#x2015;and ordinary&#x2015;lives.

The poetic and cultural tradition forged by the Symbolist poets -- Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Verlaine, Appollinaire, and others -- reverberated throughout the avant garde and counter-cultures of the twentieth century. Modernism, surrealism, abstract impressionism, and the Beat movement are unthinkable without the example of these poets and their theories of art, making this reissue possibly the hippest "dead white European male" anthology ever published.<p>Including translations by Richmond Lattimore, W. S. Merwin, Dudley Fitts, and Richard Wilbur, this anthology has stood the test of time in terms of its selection and scholarly apparatus. Now back in print after twenty years in a fresh new edition, the book features an introduction by Patti Smith that testifies to its epochal impact on her own career, as well as those of other influential latter-day poets, including Lou Reed and Jim Carroll.

McGurl asks both how the patronage of the university has reorganized American literature and&#x2015;even more important&#x2015;how the increasing intimacy of writing and schooling can be brought to bear on a reading of this literature.</p><p>McGurl argues that far from occasioning a decline in the quality or interest of American writing, the rise of the creative writing program has instead generated a complex and evolving constellation of aesthetic problems that have been explored with energy and at times brilliance by authors ranging from Flannery O&#x2019;Connor to Vladimir Nabokov, Philip Roth, Raymond Carver, Joyce Carol Oates, and Toni Morrison. </p><p>Through transformative readings of these and many other writers, <i>The Program Era</i> becomes a meditation on systematic creativity&#x2015;an idea that until recently would have seemed a contradiction in terms, but which in our time has become central to cultural production both within and beyond the university. </p><p>An engaging and stylishly written examination of an era we thought we knew, <i>The Program Era</i> will be at the center of debates about postwar literature and culture for years to come.</p></p><p>Mark McGurl is a Professor of English at Stanford University.&#x201c;It is a clich� to say that a book so changes your view of a particular historical period or problem that you never see it the same old way again. But this is the kind of book that warrants such praise. McGurl has brought deep learning, sweeping ambition, and stylistic brio together here to produce a whole new story of postwar American fiction. There is nothing else like it on the shelves of contemporary literary criticism.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jim English, author of <i>The Economy of Prestige: Prizes, Awards, and the Circulation of Cultural Value</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Program Era</i> is a brilliant book of great ambition and originality. It will be rightly regarded as a landmark work and will shape the critical understanding of postwar American literature and culture for many years to come.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Sean McCann, author of <i>A Pinnacle of Feeling: American Literature and Presidential Government</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Program Era</i> juxtaposes an unlikely cast of writers between its covers: Flannery O&#x2018;Connor, Toni Morrison, Thomas Pynchon, Raymond Carver, Philip Roth, George Saunders, and on. McGurl positions this diverse crew squarely in the context of the remarkable growth of creative writing programs in the U.S. after World War Two. McGurl&#x2018;s reinterpretation of these writers, whom scholars have so often read separately from one another, promises to unsettle all the standard ways literary historians carve up the postwar world of letters. McGurl has a rare talent for writing literary criticism that smuggles its theoretical concepts into your brain under the cover of lucid and readable and unpretentious prose. Academic literary critics, perhaps by necessity, spend lots of time becoming specialists in their patch of intellectual turf and speaking only to each other in an ever-subdividing glossolalia of theory. If we're lucky, McGurl&#x2018;s book will inaugurate for us a new genre of literary history that, though wholly intelligible to the general reader, doesn't pull its punches or water down the complexity of its vision.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lee Konstantinou, <i>The Believer</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The institutionalized teaching of creative writing thrives in America. In Mark McGurl's wide-ranging, audacious study, the academy comes to define postwar fiction in surprising ways. You won't think of most of your favorite authors quite the same way again.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ed Park, author of <i>Personal Days</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[There's] much food for thought in what [McGurl] has to say about literary trends. Most, interesting, though, is his sensitive exploration of the interplay between individual writers and the Creative Writing programs...Opinionated and lively...He delivers a cornucopia of exciting new ideas and insights in a work which will be indispensable reading for teachers and students of creative writing, and for anyone interested in modern fiction...[A] complex, energetic and fascinating book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>�il�s N� Dhuibhne</b><b>, </b><b><i>Irish Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;McGurl does have some smart things to say about the evolution of this creative writing movement--he documents it as part of the rise of progressive education in general--and about the many paradoxes involved when universities get in the business of trying to structure, codify and reward artistic endeavor.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Charles McGrath</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;What has the movement of postwar writing into the university done to our literature?...The obvious nature of this question only places the decades-long lack of a proper answer in higher relief. It is proportionately exhilarating to find, in Mark McGurl's <i>The Program Era</i>, a brilliant and comprehensive mind developing one at last. McGurl trains his gaze on the university writing programs and some of the masterful novelists they have incubated. But he makes his most compelling arguments at the level of the writer's practical place in the academy, examining the distorting (and enabling) effects of university discipline on individual artists, and considering the wider role of "creative writing" within a chain of notions of creativity (lasting from high school to the service-economy workplace) that inculcate skills for late-capitalist life...McGurl gives the best account I have seen of [Flannery] O'Connor's cruel maximization of "ironic distance"; in her third-person narration, she aspires, as he puts it, almost "to the unimaginable condition of fourth person narration--narration from a higher dimension." His pages on Raymond Carver and '80s minimalism, a mode that "came to be seen, oversimplifing the case drastically, as the 'house style' of the creative writing program," are similarly unrivaled...McGurl's clear-sighted exposure of the hidden institutional background of postwar literary production is one of the first reliable signs that we will finally see that era thoroughly anatomized in a new generation of scholarship.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mark Greif</b><b>, </b><b><i>Bookforum</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;McGurl's book is not a history of creative-writing programs. It's a history of twentieth-century fiction, in which the work of American writers from Thomas Wolfe to Bharati Mukherjee is read as reflections of, and reflections on, the educational system through which so many writers now pass...<i>The Program Era</i> is an impressive and imaginative book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Louis Menand</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Yorker</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;McGurl performs a complicated series of critical and interpretive maneuvers in <i>The Program Era</i>.

In this book, Petroski delves deeper into the mystery of invention, to explore what everyday artifacts and sophisticated networks can reveal about the way engineers solve problems.</p><p>Engineering entails more than knowing the way things work. What do economics and ecology, aesthetics and ethics, have to do with the shape of a paper clip, the tab of a beverage can, the cabin design of a turbojet, or the course of a river? How do the idiosyncrasies of individual engineers, companies, and communities leave their mark on projects from Velcro� to fax machines to waterworks?<i>Invention by Design</i> offers an insider's look at these political and cultural dimensions of design and development, production and construction.</p><p>Readers unfamiliar with engineering will find Petroski's enthusiasm contagious, whether the topic is the genesis of the Ziploc baggie or the averted collapse of Manhattan's sleekest skyscraper. And those who inhabit the world of engineering will discover insights to challenge their customary perspective, whether their work involves failure analysis, systems design, or public relations. Written with the flair that readers have come to expect from his books, <i>Invention by Design</i> reaffirms Petroski as the master explicator of the principles and processes that turn thoughts into the many things that define our made world.</p></p><p>Henry Petroski is the Aleksandar S. Vesic Professor of Civil Engineering and Professor of History at Duke University.If in <i>Invention by Design</i> Henry Petroski doesn't quite endow engineers with all the nobility and cachet of the artist, he does make the products of their work--the beer cans from which we drink, the airplanes in which we fly--the interesting things they truly are. Each of these--along with the paper clip, pencil, zipper, fax machine, water-supply system, bridge and skyscraper--Petroski honors with a heavily illustrated chapter, each a glimpse into the workings of engineering design...[Petroski] tells a good story. (Robert Kanigal <i>Civilization</i>)<br><br>This is a delightful book to read. Ostensibly, written for intelligent laypersons to give some understanding of how we got to the technological world in which we now live, it will probably be read and enjoyed as much or even more by engineering and product designers. (Peter J. Booker <i>Engineering Designer</i>)<br><br>Petroski light-heartedly though soundly exposes the so-called engineer's thinking, which from its position within the field of science and technology is more concerned with designing than with calculating. The book makes elegant connections between the design features of a variety of "engineering products." These are discussed in the most natural-seeming of series; from paper clip, pencil and zipper, via problems of water and air transport, to designs for bridges and skyscrapers. The reader is, as it were, trained to be an inquisitive designer. Scattered throughout the book are brief mental exercises in the shape of entertaining questions regarding designed details of the real world (Why are ashtrays in aircraft glued shut? What structural precautions need to be taken if a complete oil platform, whose length is greater than the height of the highest building in the world, is to be moved from a horizontal to a vertical position?) This arrangement explains why the book is required reading for many a student. But Petroski also achieves the necessary depth whenever he explains in detail the principles and processes which lie behind existing and widely known products...[<i>Invention by Design</i>] does comprise an outstanding source of knowledge and inspiration as much about history as about design approaches. (Marc Maurer <i>Archis [The Netherlands]</i>)<br><br><i>Invention by Design</i> should be required reading for all present and future engineers. (Dennis J. Fallon <i>ASEE Prism</i>)<br><br>People who think engineering is a bore have never read anything by Henry Petroski. A professor of civil engineering and history at Duke University, Petroski is notable for writing an entire book about pencils...and making the whole 400 pages completely fascinating. His newest book, which proclaims itself as showing `how engineers get from thought to thing,' is equally interesting...<i>Invention by Design</i> uses 10 short case studies to introduce some of the discipline's salient principles and techniques...Readers end up with a wonderful accumulation of fun facts...Such details do more than entertain. They show how engineers work and emphasize how engineers must go beyond design and analysis to consider the risks and consequences of a product's failure, ensure quality control, minimize costs and satisfy the dictates of aesthetics, politics and social attitudes. (John R. Alden <i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i>)<br><br>[A] lucid and lively book...Whether designing something as small as a pencil or as large as the World Trade Center, successful engineers must not only devise new technology but also find a way to situate that technology within the existing economic, social, and ecological order. Every case study includes well-chosen pictures and schematic drawings to clarify how inventors resolve technical difficulties, and the carefully researched text explains how they make their new creations economically feasible and socially acceptable. Students of technology will delight in one part of the book, cultural historians in another, but both groups will praise the author. (Bryce Christensen <i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>Petroski...has done much to make the nerdy world of engineering interesting and accessible to the reader. Here, he's after a difference audience, one interested in the philosophy and cultural study of the process of invention...This book is engaging...[It's] good reading for those interested in the gestalt of engineering design. (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>Petroski is, essentially, a cheerleader for civil engineers, who are at their most successful when their designs blend so completely into our environment that we forget about the magnificent achievements they represent. Here Petroski takes a look at the development of such things as pencils, zippers, paper clips, the fax machine, turbojet aircraft, suspension bridges, aluminum beverage cans, and the systems that heat and cool modern buildings...[A] pleasant, readable, and persuasive [book]. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>Henry Petroski does it again: bringing engineering to life. Engineering design is a very human activity, with social and cultural factors playing as much a role as science and mechanics. Nobody tells the story better than Petroski, with his meticulously researched case histories of objects that range from the small and ordinary to the large and complex. Our understanding of design is, once again, made richer and more profound. (Donald A. Norman, Vice President, Apple Computer, and author of <i>Things That Make Us Smart</i>)<br><br>Magicians are famous for keeping their `tricks' a secret. Inventors and engineers are often thought to have the same attitude about their often remarkable technological achievements. Ask a person on the street how zippers, pop-top aluminum cans, or fax machines work, and you're likely to get a shrug and an anguished admission: `I don't even know how to program my VCR.' At last, the always enlightening--and entertaining--Henry Petroski explains many of the more confounding technological riddles of modern life in <i>Invention by Design</i>. This is a delightful book and a `must read' for anyone who wants to know how the modern world got to be the way it is. (Norman R. Augustine, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin Corporation)</p><h2>Intention</h2><p><i>Intention</i> is one of the masterworks of twentieth-century philosophy in English. First published in 1957, it has acquired the status of a modern philosophical classic.

This is a welcome reprint of a book that continues to grow in importance.</p><p>G. E. M. Anscombe was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge.Anscombe's classic work is the font from which all subsequent philosophical thought about agency flows. (Robert B. Brandom, University of Pittsburgh)<br><br>What Anscombe has done is to cut through a whole mess of philosophical clich�s, and to give us a fresh, detailed picture of the concept of an action, and of related notions such as that of a reason for acting&#x2015;and this in a way which brings out clearly the sources of a host of philosophical muddles in which one can find oneself in dealing with these concepts. To have done that is to have made a significant contribution to philosophy.

It is still an indispensable guide. (Cora Diamond, University of Virginia)<br><br>Anscombe's fusion of the Aristotelian and analytical traditions is one of the highest peaks of 20th century philosophy; it has lost none of its power to destroy philosophical complacency and excite new philosophical thought. (Michael Thompson, University of Pittsburgh)<br><br>Often quoted, sometimes read, rarely understood, Anscombe's <i>Intention</i> is nevertheless the defining moment in 20th-century philosophy of action. (J. David Velleman, University of Michigan)<br><br><i>Intention</i> is a classic of modern philosophical psychology. It is unashamedly Wittgensteinian in organization and style--and Wittgensteinian too in its breaking of new ground and unerring sense of a new question, an unnoticed connection, an unexamined assumption. The freshness and intensity of the writing remain most impressive. (Crispin Wright, University of St. Andrews)<br><br>Elizabeth Anscombe's <i>Intention</i> is an extraordinary work: with penetrating acumen, delightfully dry wit, and not a single wasted breath, over the course of less than a hundred pages, it manages to make signal contributions to the philosophy of action, mind, and language, to moral philosophy, and to the interpretation of Aristotle and Wittgenstein.

Yet it is former policewoman Bernadette Manuelito, recently relocated to the Border Patrol at the U.S.&#x2013;Mexico line, who possibly holds the key to a fiendishly twisted conspiracy of greed, lies, and murder&#x2014;and whose only hope for survival now rests in the hands of friends too far away for comfort.</p></p><p>Tony Hillerman is a national treasure, having achieved critical acclaim, chart-topping popularity, and a sterling reputation as an ambassador between whites and Indians. Fortunately, he's also still a marvelous writer, much imitated but never equaled. <i>The Sinister Pig</i>--his 16th novel to feature Navajo cops Joe Leaphorn and/or Jim Chee--isn't his best book, but it's still a pleasure from the first page to the last. Its plot is almost too complex to summarize, involving the mysterious shooting of an ex-CIA agent, financial shenanigans around oil-and-gas royalties, disappearing congressional interns, exotic pipeline technology, and the cross-border trade in both drugs and illegal aliens.<p> Officer Bernadette Manuelito has left the Navajo Tribal Police for the U.S. Customs Service, patrolling the barren borderlands of southern New Mexico. There, her curiosity and smarts land her in a growing peril that provides much of the book's suspense--and invokes the protective instincts of Sergeant Chee, who still hasn't quite been able to tell her how he feels about her. It's impossible not to care about Hillerman's exquisitely drawn repertory characters, nor to overlook the pleasures of his beautifully crafted and relaxed-seeming prose. In the midst of these virtues are a few warts: several sections are a little flat or awkward, and the villainous plutocrat behind it all is short on plausibility (though lots of fun to hate). But even a lesser Hillerman is still a richer, more satisfying read than most authors' top stuff. <i>--Nicholas H.

Is my inner awareness of myself something separate from my body?<br><br>In what began as a series of essays in The New York Review of Books, John Searle evaluates the positions on consciousness of such well-known scientists and philosophers as Francis Crick, Gerald Edelman, Roger Penrose, Daniel Dennett, David Chalmers, and Israel Rosenfield. He challenges claims that the mind works like a computer, and that brain functions can be reproduced by computer programs. With a sharp eye for confusion and contradiction, he points out which avenues of current research are most likely to come up with a biological examination of how conscious states are caused by the brain.<br><br>Only when we understand how the brain works will we solve the mystery of consciousness, and only then will we begin to understand issues ranging from artificial intelligence to our very nature as human beings.</p><p><b>John R. Searle</b> is the Slusser Professor of Philosophy at &nbsp;the University of California, Berkeley. His most recent book is �<i>Making the Social World</i>. (October 2014)For sheer intellectual brio, it would be hard to beat John R. Searle's <i>The Mystery of Consciousness</i>. Mr. Searle, a philosopher at Berkeley, casts a critical eye on recent attempts to solve the mind-body problem--how it is that the lump of gray meat in your skull produces consciousness--by eminent thinkers like Daniel Dennett, Roger Penrose and Francis Crick. Often he gives a clearer account of their ideas than can be found in their own books. With vigorous logic, he teases out the contradictions of dualism, materialism and computer-inspired "artificial intelligence," which denies the very existence of consciousness. For evidence to the contrary, he urges the reader to pinch himself--which is the only thing that might detract from the pleasure of this book. -- <i>The Wall Street Journal, Jim Holt</i></p><h2>Reason for the Hope Within</h2><p>During the last two decades there has been a renaissance in the field of Christian philosophy.

Before the trip&#x2019;s end, she develops psychosis, a complete break from reality, which causes her to lose all sense of time and place, including what is real and not real. In desperation, her husband admits her to a nearby psychiatric hospital, where she begins the hard work of rebuilding her identity. In this unwaveringly honest, insightful, and often shocking memoir Catherine reconstructs her sense of self, starting with her childhood as the daughter of Korean immigrants, moving through a traumatic past relationship, and on to the early years of her courtship with and marriage to her husband, James. She masterfully interweaves these parts of her past with a vivid, immediate recounting of the days she spent in the ward.</p><p>The result is a powerful exploration of psychosis and motherhood, at once intensely personal, yet holding within it a universal experience &#x2013; of how we love, live and understand ourselves in relation to each other.</p></p><p><b>Catherine Cho</b> works in publishing.

Pat and Cassandra ultimately married, partly because Pat hated the commute from coastal South Carolina to her native Alabama. It was a union that would last eighteen years, until the beloved literary icon&#x2019;s death from pancreatic cancer in 2016.</p><p>In this poignant, intimate memoir, the woman he called King Ray looks back at her love affair with a natural-born storyteller whose lust for life was fueled by a passion for literature, food, and the Carolina Lowcountry that was his home. As she reflects on their relationship and the eighteen years they spent together, cut short by Pat&#x2019;s passing at seventy, Cassandra reveals how the marshlands of the South Carolina Lowcountry ultimately cast their spell on her, too, and how she came to understand the convivial, generous, funny, and wounded flesh-and-blood man beneath the legend&#x2014;her husband, the original Prince of Tides.</p></p><p><p><strong>Cassandra King</strong> is an award winning and&nbsp;bestselling novelist whose fiction has won the hearts of readers everywhere, especially in the American south.

He was born in 1972 in Oxford, grew up around the world and has worked with the United Nations as a humanitarian relief worker and peacekeeper in the Caucasus, the Sahel, and the Balkans. His experiences have driven his writing, in which he explores what happens to normal people&#x2014;those stricken by conflict, by disaster&#x2014;when they are put under abnormal pressures.&nbsp;***This excerpt is from an advance uncorrected copy proof*** <br><br>Copyright � 2016 Luke McCallin<br><br><p></p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Berlin, early 1947</p><p>Monday</p><p>Reinhardt had come to prefer the nights.</p><p>The nights were when things felt cleaner, clearer. The nights were when his city could sometimes resemble something more than the shattered ruin it was. The nights were when he did have to look down at the dust and grit that floured his shoes and trousers, the innards of his city turned out and spread wide for all to see. It was the days when Berlin emerged scarred and scorched into the light, when its people arose to chase their shadows through the day, wending their way from who knew where to who knew what beneath frowning escarpments of ruin and rubble, which humped up and away in staggered mounds of wreckage, and through which the roads seemed to wind like the dried-out bottoms of riverbeds.</p><p>It was very early on a Monday morning when the call came in, a body in a stairwell in an apartment building in the American sector of Berlin, down in Neuk�lln. These were bad hours by anyone&#x2019;s reckoning, the hours no one wanted, the hours married men were curled up asleep with their wives, the single men with their girls, when even drunks found a corner to sleep it off. They were the hours those on the chief&#x2019;s blacklist worked. They were the hours they gave the probationers&#x2014;those too new to the force to maneuver themselves a better shift&#x2014;or those too old but who had nowhere to go.</p><p>Reinhardt knew he was closer to the second category than to the first. But however those hours were counted by others, he considered them his best, when it was quiet and he could have the squad room all but to himself, or else wander the darkened streets and avenues, winding his way past the avalanche slides of brick and debris, learning the new architecture the war had gouged across Berlin&#x2019;s fa�ades. He and his city were strangers to each other, he knew. They had moved on in different ways, and these night hours&#x2014;these witching hours, when he would sometimes chase the moon across the city&#x2019;s jagged skyline, spying it through the rents and fissures deep within buildings, watching the play of light and shadow in places it should never have been seen&#x2014;were what he needed to rediscover it, what it was, and what had become of it.</p><p>All this, though, was in the back of his mind as the ambulance followed the dull glow of its headlights down a road swept clear along its middle, pocked and pitted with shell craters and tears in its surface, a suggestion of looming ruin to either side. He spotted the building up ahead, the fitful yellow beams of flashlights wobbling yolk-like in its entrance and casting the shadows of people up the walls and out into the street. He climbed stiffly out of the ambulance, switching on his own flashlight as he turned up the channel cleared between the rubble. He paused. He swung the flashlight at the entrance of a ruined building across the road. Hidden in the shadows, a pack of children watched with glittering eyes, vanishing from view when he held the light on them a moment longer.</p><p>A uniformed officer in his archaic uniform, complete with brass-fronted gray shako, watched as Reinhardt knocked the dust from his shoes in the building&#x2019;s entry, pocketing his flashlight.</p><p>&#x201c;There we were about to send for the American MPs, but it looks like the Yanks have shown up anyway,&#x201d; the young officer quipped.</p><p>&#x201c;Which police station are you from?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Reuterstrasse,&#x201d; said the policeman, his face clenching in suspicion.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll speak to whoever&#x2019;s in charge here,&#x201d; said Reinhardt, holding the younger officer&#x2019;s eyes as he took his hat off.</p><p>The officer&#x2019;s face darkened, but he cocked his head inside. &#x201c;Sergeant. Sergeant!&#x201d;</p><p>A second officer pushed his way out of a crowd of people milling in the entrance. Reinhardt thought he recognized him, a man well into middle age, tall, lanky, with old-fashioned sideburns&#x2014;although it if was him, the man used to be a lot heftier and bulkier.</p><p>&#x201c;Cavalry&#x2019;s here, Sarge,&#x201d; the young officer said. Reinhardt ignored him as the older officer threw his colleague a reproachful look.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, sir,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What Officer Diechle means, sir, is we was about to call the Amis, I mean, the American Military Police. We didn&#x2019;t know if anyone was coming out from Kripo at this hour.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, some of us detectives are up and about,&#x201d; Reinhardt said, smiling, his voice soft. &#x201c;Inspector Reinhardt, Sch�neberg Kripo Division.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. No offense at our surprise in seeing you, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And why&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because they don&#x2019;t usually stir themselves for what seems like accidents or open-and-shut cases,&#x201d; said Diechle. &#x201c;&#x2019;Specially not at this hour.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who says it was either of those?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He was drunk, he fell down the stairs,&#x201d; Diechle snorted. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all it is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Show me what you&#x2019;ve found. Sergeant Frunze, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Reinhardt suddenly remembered the man&#x2019;s name, feeling it slip onto his tongue from out of nowhere, it seemed. Something in the man&#x2019;s appearance, those old-fashioned side-burns, the accent triggering a memory of a line of struggling, sweating policeman trying to hold apart a seething mass of Nazis and Communists, and Frunze reeling away with blood sheeting his cheeks but a brown-shirted thug caught under his arm, the lout&#x2019;s face turning red inside the policeman&#x2019;s armlock as Frunze calmly recited the man&#x2019;s rights to him.</p><p>&#x201c;That it is, sir. Frunze. Very glad to see you remember, sir,&#x201d; he said, ignoring the way his younger colleague rolled his eyes. &#x201c;This way, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Last time I saw you, you were up in one of the Tiergarten stations.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Time&#x2019;s moved on a bit, sir. You go where they send you these days,&#x201d; Frunze replied, a quick glance at Reinhardt. He could not tell what the glance might have meant, but an experienced officer like Frunze, especially one his age, ought not to be running a night shift in a place like Neuk�lln. It had always been a rough neighborhood. Left-wing, working class, where the cops had never been welcome, and Reinhardt did not think things had changed much as Frunze led him through the small crowd of people to the bottom of the stairs, over to where the body of a man lay, face up. The light in the entrance was a shifting mix of flashlights, candles, and lanterns held by the policemen and by the cluster of people&#x2014;men, women, and children&#x2014;to the side of the stairs. It made for a confusing play of shadows, but there was light enough for Reinhardt to see that the man&#x2019;s nose and mouth were a puffed and bruised welter of blood that fanned the bottom of his face and jaw and had soaked into the clothes on his left shoulder. There were scratches and lesions on his face, on his scalp, and on his hands, the skin of his knuckles stripped raw. Reinhardt&#x2019;s eyes were drawn back to the injuries around the nose and mouth, the wounds framed by black and blue discolorations that indicated he had received them some time before dying. If he got those falling down the stairs, Reinhardt thought, he would have lain here a good long time before dying and there was no pooling of blood, so far as he could see.</p><p>&#x201c;Has forensics arrived, yet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It should be Berthold coming. I called him before I left. Any identification on the body?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;None, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Keys? Money?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Reinhardt pulled on a thin pair of old leather gloves, then reached under the man&#x2019;s neck, lifting it gently. The head did not quite follow, slipping from side to side.</p><p>&#x201c;Broken neck, sir?&#x201d; asked Frunze.</p><p>&#x201c;It would seem so. Anyone find a bottle?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; Frunze sighed. &#x201c;But the man does smell of booze. I reckon he spilled a bit down the front of his clothes. But much as Diechle would like this to be open and shut, I&#x2019;ve a feeling it&#x2019;s not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Probably not. Who found him, Sergeant?&#x201d; he asked, gently feeling and pinching his way down the man&#x2019;s arms, feeling the heft to the limbs.</p><p>&#x201c;The building&#x2019;s superintendent. Or, what passes for one these days, sir. Here.&#x201d; Frunze indicated an elderly man in a threadbare dressing gown with a tangled rosette of iron-gray hair running around his head from ear to ear, a scarf bunched tight around his neck. &#x201c;Name&#x2019;s Ochs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Ochs,&#x201d; Reinhardt addressed him as he knelt, his left knee stretching painfully as he did. &#x201c;Tell me what you heard and saw,&#x201d; he said as he ran his fingers down the man&#x2019;s clothes, reaching carefully under the collar of the overcoat. Some men, black marketers and criminals in particular, had been known to sew razor blades under the lapels, but there was nothing. Reinhardt felt the fabric of the man&#x2019;s coat, his shirt, the tie knotted loosely beneath his chin.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. Well, it would have been about two o&#x2019;clock in the morning. I heard a man calling for help, then I heard a terrible thumping. There was another cry, I think as the poor soul hit the bottom, then nothing. I came out of my rooms, just there,&#x201d; he said, pointing at a door ajar next to the entrance, &#x201c;and found him.&#x201d;</p><p>Reinhardt shone his flashlight at the stairs, the light glistening back from something wet about halfway up.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you seen him before?&#x201d; Ochs shook his head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure? He&#x2019;s not a tenant? Not a displaced person the municipality&#x2019;s moved in recently.&#x201d; Ochs shook his head to all of it.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s no DP, sir,&#x201d; said Frunze. When Reinhardt encouraged him to go on, Frunze pointed at the man&#x2019;s coat, at his shoes. &#x201c;Look at that quality. You don&#x2019;t find that in Berlin these days. If he&#x2019;s a DP, he&#x2019;s a well-off one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Sergeant,&#x201d; said Reinhardt, watching Diechle out of the corner of his eye as the younger officer followed their discussion. The man was no displaced person, Reinhardt was sure. His clothes were too good, his fingernails too clean, his hair had been cut recently, and quite well. He had been well-fed, the weight of his limbs and the texture of his skin testament to that. &#x201c;These other people,&#x201d; he said to Ochs. &#x201c;The building&#x2019;s tenants?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Any of them hear or notice anything?&#x201d; he asked both Ochs and Frunze.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing, sir,&#x201d; answered the sergeant. &#x201c;One or two of them said they were awakened by the noise of the man falling. One of them says she thinks she might have seen him before, though.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bring her, please,&#x201d; he said to Frunze. &#x201c;Is everyone living in the building here, Ochs?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not everyone, sir. There&#x2019;s some who work nights, and one person&#x2019;s away traveling.&#x201d;</p><p>Frunze came forward escorting a woman carrying a young child, two more children in her wake. &#x201c;Madam,&#x201d; said Reinhardt. &#x201c;You told the police you might have seen this man?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think so. Once or twice. The last time maybe two days ago, each time on the stairs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you say anything to each other?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Only a greeting. Nothing else.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you notice anything about him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Anything. Was he in a hurry? Did he seem worried?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. We just passed each other.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, madam. We&#x2019;ll have you all back to bed soon,&#x201d; Reinhardt said, a small smile for the little boy with a tousled head of hair. &#x201c;Have you had a look around upstairs, Sergeant?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not really, sir. We didn&#x2019;t want to mess anything up for the detectives.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very well. We&#x2019;ll have a look now. Ochs, you come with me, please. Diechle, please tell the ambulance men to wait for Berthold before moving this body. And Diechle? There&#x2019;s some children outside, probably living homeless across the street. See if you can persuade one or two of them to talk to us. And Diechle,&#x201d; he insisted, as the young officer&#x2019;s face darkened again. &#x201c;No rough stuff. Just ask them.&#x201d;</p><p>Sweeping his flashlight from side to side across each step, Reinhardt started upstairs. He passed the first smears of blood he had seen from the bottom, about halfway up. At the top of the first flight, where the stairs turned tightly around and continued up, there was another spattering on the floor, a streak on the banister, as if a man had stood there, catching his breath, perhaps calling for help, swaying back and forth through his pain. Up to the first floor, his feet crunching in the dust and clots of plaster and rubble that salted the stairs, more stains, more smudges on the wood of the banister. There were two doors on the first-floor landing, and Ochs confirmed the tenants&#x2014;the woman Reinhardt had talked to with her three young children, and an elderly couple&#x2014;were downstairs.</p><p>Feeling like Hansel following the bread crumbs, Reinhardt continued upstairs to the second floor, the building&#x2019;s smell growing around him, a smell of people too closely packed together, of damp washing and bad food. At the second-floor landing, Ochs told him the tenants&#x2014;a widow and another family&#x2014;were also downstairs.</p><p>&#x201c;All the ladies are on the first two floors. As of the third, the building&#x2019;s in a bit of a state, still. It&#x2019;s not been fully repaired, you&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;</p><p>On the third floor, the building took on a different register, the walls a labyrinthine scrawl of cracks and rents from the damage it had suffered, and the strains it must still be under. The corners of the stairs and landings were rounded with dust and plaster swept and pushed to the sides. A draft swirled down from somewhere up above. Only one apartment on the third floor was inhabited&#x2014;a man away traveling&#x2014;the other was boarded shut, war damage rendering the apartment uninhabitable, said Ochs. The same was true of the two apartments above it, the little superintendent said, puffing behind Reinhardt with his dressing gown bunched in one fist to hold it clear of his slippered feet.</p><p>As the damage became worse, the building seemed to become malodorous, dark, a listening dark, a dark that seemed to shuffle quietly back away from him as if cautious, as if the structure was sensitive to the harm men had wrought upon it. On the fourth floor, Ochs pointed to an apartment that was locked up, where the tenant&#x2014;Mr. Uthmann&#x2014;worked nights on the railways. There was one floor remaining, and Reinhardt paused at the landing, looking at the door that stood ajar, moving slightly back and forth in the draft.</p><p>&#x201c;Who lives there?&#x201d;</p><p>Ochs caught his breath leaning on the banister. &#x201c;Mr. Noell,&#x201d; he managed. &#x201c;He lives alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not downstairs?&#x201d; asked Reinhardt, being careful to hide his own breathing. It was very short, and he felt dizzy with the effort of climbing the stairs.</p><p>&#x201c;No. He is out sometimes. I didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Ochs puffed, &#x201c;didn&#x2019;t think his absence downstairs anything out of the ordinary.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the body downstairs is not this Noell?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>Reinhardt shone his flashlight across the floor, tracking its beam through the fallen plaster and rubble, not knowing if the scuffed pattern showed the tracks of anyone having passed through it all. &#x201c;Well, let&#x2019;s see if he knew your Mr. Noell.&#x201d;</p><p>Reinhardt drew his police baton, flicking it out to its full extension. With the lead ball at the tip, he pushed the door open. The first thing his light illuminated inside was a streak of blood on the wall, from about head height and down. He saw a light switch and turned it on, watching the room&#x2019;s only bulb come fitfully to life.</p><p>One of the windows had glass in its frame, the other a mix of wood and cardboard, most of it from CARE package...</p></p><h2>The Buddhist on Death Row: How One Man Found Light in the Darkest Place</h2><p><b>The #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Beautiful Boy</i></b><i> </i><b>explores the transformation of Jarvis Jay Masters who has become one of America&#x2019;s most inspiring Buddhist practitioners while locked in a cell on death row. </b><br><br>Jarvis Jay Masters&#x2019;s early life was a horror story whose outline we know too well. Born in Long Beach, California, his house was filled with crack, alcohol, physical abuse, and men who paid his mother for sex. He and his siblings were split up and sent to foster care when he was five, and he progressed quickly to juvenile detention, car theft, armed robbery, and ultimately San Quentin. While in prison, he was set up for the murder of a guard&#x2014;a conviction which landed him on death row, where he&#x2019;s been since 1990.<br> <br>At the time of his murder trial, he was held in solitary confinement, torn by rage and anxiety, felled by headaches, seizures, and panic attacks. A criminal investigator repeatedly offered to teach him breathing exercises which he repeatedly refused. Until desperation moved him to ask her how to do &#x201c;that meditation shit.&#x201d; With uncanny clarity, David Sheff describes Masters&#x2019;s gradual but profound transformation from a man dedicated to hurting others to one who has prevented violence on the prison yard, counseled high school kids by mail, and helped prisoners&#x2014;and even guards&#x2014;find meaning in their lives.<br> <br>Along the way, Masters becomes drawn to the principles that Buddhism espouses&#x2014;compassion, sacrifice, and living in the moment&#x2014;and he gains the admiration of Buddhists worldwide, including many of the faith&#x2019;s most renowned practitioners. And while he is still in San Quentin and still on death row, he is a renowned Buddhist thinker who shows us how to ease our everyday suffering, relish the light that surrounds us, and endure the tragedies that befall us all.</p><p>David Sheff is the author of multiple books including the #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling memoir <i>Beautiful Boy</i>, which was recently turned into a movie starring Steve Carell and Timoth�e Chalamet. His work has appeared in <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Outside</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Wired</i>, <i>Fortune</i>, and elsewhere. His piece for <i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>, &#x201c;My Addicted Son,&#x201d; received an award from the American Psychological Association for Outstanding Contribution to Advancing the Understanding of Addictions.</p><h2>The Unbreakable Code</h2><p>John&#39;s mother is getting married and he has to leave the reservation. John&#39;s grandfather tells him he has the special unbreakable code to take with him. This story portrays the quiet pride of a Navajo code talker as he explains to his grandson how the Navajo language, faith and ingenuity helped win World War II. Full color.</p><p>Julia Miner is an architect, designer, and artist who has illustrated three books for children: Lighthouse Santa, The Unbreakable Code, and The Shepherd&#39;s Song.Setting a solidly intriguing, little-known historical episode within a fictional framework, Hunter (Don't Touch My Stuff) pays warm tribute to the Navajo "code talkers" who served in the Marine Corps during World War II. To comfort a grandson distraught about an upcoming move, an elderly Navajo man tells him about the time that he, too, had to leave their canyon home and, along with hundreds of other Navajo men, came to perform a crucial mission for the U.S. government. The Navajo language, which had never been written down and was virtually unknown to outsiders, became a "secret weapon" in preventing the Japanese from intercepting and decoding American radio messages. Hunter's lengthy but absorbing story, based on interviews with former code talkers, casts a well-deserved spotlight on these skilled soldiers and on a wartime role that is almost guaranteed to interest readers. Miner's (The Shepherd's Song) subtly textured oil paintings realistically depict serene canyon landscapes, tense battle scenes and the affectionate rapport between the narrator and his grandson. Young code-crackers will appreciate the inclusion of the original Navajo code in the endnotes.

Now she dishes up another dangerously tasty treat of murder and mystery.<br><br>For Colorado caterer Goldy Schulz, accepting a series of bookings at Hyde Castle is like a dream come true. It&#x2019;s not every day that she gets to cook authentic Elizabethan fare--especially at a real castle that was brought over from England and reassembled stone by stone in Aspen Meadow. Goldy is determined that everything will go right--which is why, she figures later, everything went terribly wrong. It begins when a shotgun blast shatters her window. Then Goldy discovers a body lying in a nearby creek. And when shots ring out for the second time that day, someone Goldy loves is in the line of fire. Suddenly the last thing Goldy wants to think about is Shakespeare&#x2019;s Steak Pie, 911 Chocolate Emergency Cookies, or Damson-in-Distress Plum Tart. Could one of her husband Tom&#x2019;s police investigations have triggered a murder? Or was her violent, recently paroled ex responsible? With death peering around every corner, Goldy needs to cook up some crime-solving solutions--before the only dish that&#x2019;s left on her menu is murder.</p><p>Her first big catering gig in weeks has Goldy Bear Schulz salivating. But before she can collect her Elizabethan-inspired recipes (Queen of Scots Shortbread, Damson-in-Distress Plum Tart) and hie herself to the restored English castle in Colorado where she's putting on a donor's luncheon in Hyde Chapel and a high school fencing banquet in the castle's Great Room, someone blows a hole in her living room window. No sooner has she unloaded her pots and pans at the catering venue than another someone--or maybe the same one--shoots a hole in her detective husband, Tom. To make matters worse, Goldy's ex-husband has just been released from jail, and he seems to have a few reasons to want to kill her, too.<p> Between trying to solve the riddle of the castle ghost, keep her son Arch and her wounded husband safe, and get the food on the table while it's still hot, Goldy is up to her elbows in trouble. The would-be lord of the manor still looks like a business-builder for Goldy, but his Swiss-born wife seems a little wacky. And even from a sickbed, Tom's got a crime wave on his hands that seems to involve Goldy's ex, his flashy new girlfriend, the castle owner, and the dead man Goldy found floating in the castle moat. Not to mention a woman Tom once loved, who seems to have returned from the dead and is causing Goldy no end of distress. But Diane Mott Davidson's gutsy, multitalented series heroine (<i>Prime Cut</i>, <i>Tough Cookie</i>) triumphs again--the proof is in the reading as well as the eating in this fast-paced, frothy dessert. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Five-star praise for the New York Times bestselling mysteries of Diane Mott Davidson, "The Julia Child of mystery writers"*<br><br>"Today foremost practitioner of culinary whodunit."<br>-- Entertainment Weekly<br><br>"A cross between Mary Higgins Clark and Betty Crocker!"<br>-- The Sun, Baltimore<br><br>"You don't have to be a cook or a mystery fan to love Diane Mott Davidson books.

But the second the Brits open their mouths, all bets are off. So don&#x2019;t dream of visiting the UK, dating a Brit, or truly understanding what Jude Law is saying without this handy, hilarious, and informative guide to Britspeak. With the cheekiness of Austin Powers and the tidbit quotient of <i>Schott&#x2019;s Miscellany</i>, screenwriter Jonathan Bernstein&#x2019;s collection of Cockney rhyming slang, insults culled from British television shows of yore, and regional and high British&#x201d; favorites provides hours of educational, enlightening, even life saving hilarity. And if it doesn&#x2019;t accomplish that, at least you&#x2019;ll be aware that when a British citizen describes you as a wally,&#x201d; a herbert,&#x201d; a spanner,&#x201d; or a bampot,&#x201d; he&#x2019;s not showering you with compliments. <i>Knickers in a Twist</i> is as indispensable as a London city guide, as spot-on funny as an episode of <i>The Office</i>, and as edifying as <i>Born to Kvetch</i> and <i>Eats, Shoots&nbsp;and Leaves</i>.</p><p></p><h2>Probability (Springer Texts in Statistics)</h2><p>This is a text for a one-quarter or one-semester course in probability, aimed at students who have done a year of calculus. The book is organised so a student can learn the fundamental ideas of probability from the first three chapters without reliance on calculus. Later chapters develop these ideas further using calculus tools. The book contains more than the usual number of examples worked out in detail.<br>The most valuable thing for students to learn from a course like this is how to pick up a probability problem in a new setting and relate it to the standard body of theory. The more they see this happen in class, and the more they do it themselves in exercises, the better. The style of the text is deliberately informal. My experience is that students learn more from intuitive explanations, diagrams, and examples than they do from theorems and proofs. So the emphasis is on problem solving rather than theory.</p><p>Jim Pitman is a Professor in the Departments of Statistics and Mathematics in the University of California at Berkeley, USA.&nbsp;</p><h2>World War II: A New History</h2><p>This book is a magisterial global history of World War II. Beginning in 1937 with the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Evan Mawdsley shows how the origins of World War II lay in a conflict between the old international order and the new and then traces the globalisation of the conflict as it swept through Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. His primary focus is on the war&#39;s military and strategic history though he also examines the political, economic, ideological, and cultural factors which influenced the course of events. The war&#39;s consequences are examined too, not only in terms of the defeat of the Axis but also the break-up of colonial empires and the beginning of the Cold War. Accessibly written and well-illustrated with maps and photographs, this compelling new account also includes short studies of the key figures, events and battles that shaped the war.</p><p>This book is a major global history of the Second World War.

By criticizing ecclesiastical abuses, he encouraged the growing urge for reform, and&nbsp;his independent stance in an age of fierce controversy&nbsp;made him a target of suspicion for loyal partisans on both sides and a beacon for those who valued liberty over orthodoxy. <i>Praise of Folly</i> is one of his best-known works.<br><br><b>John P.

Topics range chronologically from "Origins of English Settlement" to "National Security, Terrorism, and Iraq." Essays, speeches, and letters by such notables as Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Malcolm X, and Bill Clinton provide historical context for the debates. Articles are clustered under prefaced general categories, such as "The Gilded Age," "Antebellum America," and "New Challenges after the Cold War." "The Progressive Era" includes debates about Jim Crow, child labor, and women's right to vote. Each viewpoint has an editorial introduction that highlights the author's concerns and poses two or three questions that students might ask themselves as they read the selections. For instance, in Horace Greeley's verbose open letter to Abraham Lincoln about slavery, readers are prompted to look for Greeley's descriptions of the treatment of slaves behind Union lines. A further-reading section and, occasionally, a Web site follow each viewpoint. Each volume has a separate index. New to this edition are discussions of the most recent presidential challenges, such as terrorism, nuclear weapons, health care, and separation of church and state. An increase in the book's size and a font change are a nice facelift for this reference.&#x2014;<i>Vicki Reutter, Cazenovia High School, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Only this time the carcass was the Conner family, and no one was quite dead yet.<br><br>Hap Eastman watched from a corner of the Williamsburg Community Church fellowship hall. He&#x2019;d done his part. Started the coffee, laid out the pastries, set up the chairs. It was something he did every Saturday morning for the Women&#x2019;s Aid Society, and every time it was the same. The old girls started with a list of needs and prayer requests and ended with a fullblown gossip session.<br><br>Hap&#x2019;s wife, Doris, was president, and at forty-five the youngest of the group. So Hap hung around tinkering with fixit jobs in the kitchen or perched on a cold metal folding chair in the corner, a cup of fresh brewed French Roast in one hand and a Louis L&#x2019;Amour novel in the other. Four days a week he was a jurist laden with a heavy workload and weighty decision making. Saturdays were his day to relax.<br><br>Hap had already heard the story from Doris and generally when the birds got going, he tried not to listen. But days like this it was nearly impossible.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what anyone says. We need to talk about it.&#x201d; Geraldine Rivers had the floor, and Hap eyed her suspiciously from a distance. Geraldine was a talker from way back and in charge of the social committee. Generally when the gossip got going, Doris and Geraldine fanned the fires and battled for position. Especially in the heated sessions, and Hap figured this was about as hot as they&#x2019;d ever get.<br><br>&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t read the minutes yet.&#x201d; Louella tilted her face in Geraldine&#x2019;s direction. The minutes were still tucked in her unopened Bible, so her comment was more for appearances than anything else.<br><br>&#x201c;Minutes mean nothing at a time like this!&#x201d; Geraldine nodded toward Doris. &#x201c;Tell us what you know, will you, Dorie? Several of the ladies here haven&#x2019;t heard what happened.&#x201d;<br><br>The vultures nodded in unison, and Doris took her cue.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s really very tragic, very sundry. I almost hate to talk about it at church.&#x201d; She paused for effect, smoothing the wrinkles in her polyester dress. &#x201c;You all know the Conner family, Angela and her husband, Buddy&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Buddy&#x2019;s been drinking alcohol at the tavern lately. Louella&#x2019;s husband saw his truck there last week, isn&#x2019;t that true?&#x201d; Geraldine knew this to be true but enjoyed her own voice too much to be silent for long.<br><br>Doris frowned. &#x201c;Right. He&#x2019;s become a regular drunkard. Now, Angela...well, she&#x2019;s another story. A flirtatious type, not given to things of the Lord.&#x201d; She looked around the circle. &#x201c;Nearly everyone in Williamsburg has suspected her of cheating on Buddy.&#x201d;<br><br>The old birds nodded again.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, yesterday I got a call from Betty Jean Stevens...you&#x2019;ve probably noticed she&#x2019;s not here today.&#x201d; Doris&#x2019;s face bunched up like it did when Hap forgot to take out the trash. &#x201c;Seems all those rumors were true. Betty Jean found out last week that her husband&#x2019;s been seeing Angela Conner on the side. And I don&#x2019;t mean at the Piggly Wiggly.&#x201d;<br><br>A collective gasp rose from the circle, and six of the girls started talking at once.<br><br>&#x201c;Bill Stevens and that loose woman?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why, that hypocrite!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A deacon at Williamsburg Community has committed adultery?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll need to make a public apology before I forgive him!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I knew something was happening between those two!&#x201d;<br><br>The cacophony of accusations grew until Geraldine rapped her fist on the table. &#x201c;Quiet, all of you! Quiet!&#x201d;<br><br>They had obviously forgotten about Hap and his novel, and he gazed at them over the top of his book. The biddies fell silent again, and Geraldine lowered her gaze, trying to look appropriately indignant. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s more....&#x201d;<br><br>Doris brought her hands together in a neat fold. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; She drew a deep breath. &#x201c;For the past few weeks Bill&#x2019;s been...taking a motel room with the Conner woman. Apparently she set about trying to seduce him for some time. And...well...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a temptress in every town!&#x201d; Geraldine obviously intended to maintain her presence even if it was Doris&#x2019;s story.<br><br>&#x201c;Betty Jean says Bill tried to ward off her advances. But last month...he gave in.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do declare, Angela Conner&#x2019;s a harlot. She&#x2019;s always been a whore!&#x201d; Geraldine snapped at a lemon pastry and dabbed fiercely at the filling it left on her lips.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I believe she is.&#x201d; Doris looked glad that Geraldine had said it first. Hap sighed. &#x201c;But the worst part happened last night.&#x201d;<br><br>The birds were nodding their interest, waiting breathlessly for the rest of the story.<br><br>Doris sipped her coffee, and Hap knew she was enjoying the way she held her audience captive. &#x201c;Last night...Bill Stevens ran off with her. The two of them. Just like that, they up and left town.&#x201d;<br><br>Several of the women were on their feet firing questions.<br><br>&#x201c;Where did they go?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does anyone else know?&#x201d;<br><br>Doris kept her back stiff, her nose in the air. Hap hated it when she got uppity, and this was one of those times. She answered their questions with all the condemnation she could muster.<br><br>&#x201c;D.C.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The capital?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Betty Jean says Bill sat her down last night and told her they were through. Told her he&#x2019;s in love with Angela, and they&#x2019;re starting a new life in Washington, D.C.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dear heaven, how&#x2019;s Betty Jean handling it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s ashamed, broken. But she saw it coming. About a year ago, Bill began meeting with Angela to talk about a business venture.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Business venture?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I guess we all know what type business&#x2014;&#x201d; Geraldine spat the word the way boys spit watermelon seeds on a summer day&#x2014;&#x201c;that was, don&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;<br><br>Doris hesitated. &#x201c;Betty Jean&#x2019;s just thankful the children are grown and out of the house.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Angela Conner was bad blood from the get-go. Last year, I think she was seeing that attorney in town. You know, the divorce lawyer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re right. Everyone this side of Richmond knows the Conner woman and how she was always sniffing around for a man to bed.&#x201d;<br><br>Hap raised an eyebrow. A man to bed?<br><br>&#x201c;What about Buddy?&#x201d; Again Geraldine was determined tokeep the discussion alive.<br><br>&#x201c;Buddy&#x2019;s disgraced, as well he should be. Any man who can&#x2019;t keep his wife at home should be ashamed of himself.&#x201d; Doris looked at Geraldine for approval. &#x201c;And I have it on good word that he won&#x2019;t be back to Williamsburg Community Church.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I certainly hope not.&#x201d; Geraldine finished the pastry and wadded her napkin into a tight ball of crumbs and sticky paper. &#x201c;The man&#x2019;s a drunkard.&#x201d;<br><br>There were several nods of approval, then one of the vultures gasped. &#x201c;Oh, dear heaven. What&#x2019;s going to happen to little Jade?&#x201d;<br><br><i>Jade.</i> Hap felt his heart sink. He&#x2019;d forgotten about the sweet ten-year-old, Buddy and Angela&#x2019;s only child.<br><br>Geraldine did nothing to hide her righteous indignation. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t she the one who pals around with your Tanner?&#x201d;<br><br>A deep crimson fanned across Doris&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;The Conners live in our neighborhood, in Buddy&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s house. Tanner is about the same age as the Conner girl, so it&#x2019;s only natural that the two play together. It doesn&#x2019;t happen often.&#x201d;<br><br>Doris wasn&#x2019;t telling the entire story, and Hap knew why. The reason was an ugly one. He and Dorie had two boys: Harry was twenty and worked for the city dump&#x2014;a detail Dorie never told the girls at the Women&#x2019;s Aid Society. Then there was Tanner. Even at twelve years old, Tanner was everything Harry hadn&#x2019;t been. He was bright and handsome and the finest athlete in primary school. Doris thought he was going to be president of the United States one day. How would it look if he had already made the social mistake of befriending the child of a woman like Angela Conner?<br><br>Of course, there were other reasons Doris detested the children&#x2019;s friendship. More complicated reasons. But Hap didn&#x2019;t want to think about those on a sunny Saturday in May when he was supposed to be relaxing. He shifted positions, but the biddies were too caught up to notice him.</p><h2>Red Country</h2><p>A <i>New York Times</i> bestseller!<br>They burned her home.<br>They stole her brother and sister.<br>But vengeance is following.<br><br>Shy South hoped to bury her bloody past and ride away smiling, but she'll have to sharpen up some bad old ways to get her family back, and she's not a woman to flinch from what needs doing.

This volume contains two of the most interesting and important of these dialogues. <br>The philosophic goal of the <i>Symposium</i> is to find the ultimate manifestation of the love that controls the world, leading to mystic union with eternal and supercosmic beauty. <i>Phaedrus</i> discusses the psychology of love, resulting in the concept of the familiar Platonic "forms" as objects of transcendental emotion. In this inexpensive edition of the renowned Jowett translation, they will be welcomed by anyone interested in Greek thought or the philosophy of Plato.</p><p>It has been said that, after the Bible, Plato&#39;s dialogues are the most influential books in Western culture. And of the dialogues, the &#34;Symposium is the most delightful and accessible, requiring no special knowledge of ancient Greek philosophy or customs. Dramatizing a party in fifth-century B.C. Athens, the deceptively unassuming &#34;Symposium introduces--in the guise of convivial after-dinner conversation--profound ideas about the nature of love. In &#34;Phaedrus, here published together with the &#34;Symposium, Plato discusses the place of eloquence in expounding truth. In both dialogues, Socrates plays the leading role, by turns teasing, arguing, analyzing, joking, inspiring, and cajoling his followers into understanding ideas that have remained central to Western thought through the centuries.<p>Plato ranks among the most familiar ancient philosophers, along with his teacher, Socrates, and his student, Aristotle. In addition to writing philosophical dialogues &#x2014; used to teach logic, ethics, rhetoric, religion, and mathematics as well as philosophy &#x2014; he founded Athens' Academy, the Western world's first institution of higher learning.</p></p><h2>Catastrophe: And Other Stories (Art of the Story)</h2><p><p>In <em>Catastrophe</em>, the renowned Italian short story writer Dino Buzzati brings vividly to life the slow and quietly terrifying collapse of our known, everyday world.

Over this period many things changed decisively globally, locally, and in their personal lives and these changing conditions provide the back story for a long conversation. It begins in the early 1980s as an intellectual exchange between an earnest graduate student and a generous distinguished writer, and becomes a long-distance friendship and an exploration of spiritual practice.<br><br>At the project&#x2019;s heart is Snyder&#x2019;s understanding of Buddhism. Again and again, the conversations return to an explication of the teachings. Snyder&#x2019;s characteristic approach is to articulate a direct experience of Buddhist practice rather than any kind of abstract philosophy. In the version he describes here, this practice finds expression not primarily as an Asian import or a monastic ideal, but in the specificities of a householder&#x2019;s life as lived creatively in a particular location at a particular moment in history. This means that whatever topic&#x201d; a dialogue explores, there is a sense that all of it is about practice the spiritual-social practice of a contemporary poet.</p><p><b>Gary Snyder</b> is a poet, essayist, and environmental activist.

In 1941, while the city was under Japanese occupation, she began to publish the stories and essays that established her reputation in the literary world. She left China in 1952 to escape the influence of the Communist party, settling in the United States in 1955. She continued to write novels, stories, essays, and screenplays for Hong Kong films. In the 1970s, her works became immensely popular throughout the Chinese-speaking world. Despite her growing fame, Chang grew more and more reclusive, and was found dead in her Los Angeles apartment in 1995. Her works continue to be translated into English. A film adaptation of her novella&nbsp;<i>Lust, Caution</i>, directed by Ang Lee, was released in 2007.</p>Though it was still daylight, the hot lamp was shining full-beam over the mahjong table. Diamond rings flashed under its glare as their wearers clacked and reshuffled their tiles. The tablecloth, tied down over the table legs, stretched out into a sleek plain of blinding white. The harsh artificial light silhouetted to full advantage the generous curve of Chia-chih&#39;s bosom, and laid bare the elegant lines of her hexagonal face, its beauty somehow accentuated by the imperfectly narrow forehead, by the careless, framing wisps of hair. Her makeup was understated, except for the glossily rouged arcs of her lips. Her hair she had pinned nonchalantly back from her face, then allowed to hang down to her shoulders. Her sleeveless cheongsam of electric blue moire satin reached to the knees, its shallow, rounded collar standing only half an inch tall, in the Western style. A brooch fixed to the collar matched her diamond-studded sapphire button earrings.The two ladies--tai-tais--immediately to her left and right were both wearing black wool capes, each held fast at the neck by a heavy double gold chain that snaked out from beneath the cloak&#39;s turned-down collar. Isolated from the rest of the world by Japanese occupation, Shanghai had elaborated a few native fashions. Thanks to the extravagantly inflated price of gold in the occupied territories, gold chains as thick as these were now fabulously expensive. But somehow, functionally worn in place of a collar button, they managed to avoid the taint of vulgar ostentation, thereby offering their owners the perfect pretext for parading their wealth on excursions about the city. For these excellent reasons, the cape and gold chain had become the favored uniform of the wives of officials serving in Wang Ching-wei&#39;s puppet government. Or perhaps they were following the lead of Chungking, the Chinese Nationalist regime&#39;s wartime capital, where black cloaks were very much in vogue among the elegant ladies of the political glitterati.Yee Tai-tai was chez elle, so she had dispensed with her own cape; but even without it, her figure still seemed to bell outward from her neck, with all the weight the years had put on her. She&#39;d met Chia-chih two years earlier in Hong Kong, after she and her husband had left Chungking--and the Nationalist government--together with Wang Ching-wei. Not long before the couple took refuge on the island, one of Wang Ching-wei&#39;s lieutenants, Cheng Chung-ming, had been assassinated in Hanoi, and so Wang&#39;s followers in Hong Kong were keeping their heads down. Yee Tai-tai, nonetheless, was determined to go shopping. During the war, goods were scarce in both the unconquered interior and the occupied territories of the Mainland; Yee Tai-tai had no intention of wasting the golden purchasing opportunity offered by a stopover in the commercial paradise of Hong Kong. Someone in her circle introduced her to Chia-chih--the beautiful young wife of Mr. Mai, a local businessman--who chaperoned her on her shopping trips. If you wanted to navigate Hong Kong&#39;s emporiums, you had to have a local along: you were expected to haggle over prices even in the biggest department stores, and if you couldn&#39;t speak Cantonese, all the traders would overcharge you wickedly. Mr. Mai was in import-export and, like all businesspeople, delighted in making political friends. So of course the couple were incessantly hospitable to Yee Tai-tai, who was in turn extremely grateful. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the fall of Hong Kong, Mr. Mai went out of business. To make some extra money for the family, Mai Tai-tai decided to do a little smuggling herself, and traveled to Shanghai with a few luxury goods--watches, Western medicines, perfumes, stockings--to sell. Yee Tai-tai very naturally invited her to stay with them.&#34;We went to Shu-yu, that Szechuanese restaurant, yesterday,&#34; Yee Tai-tai was telling the first black cape. &#34;Mai Tai-tai hadn&#39;t been.&#34;&#34;Oh, really?&#34;&#34;We haven&#39;t seen you here for a few days, Ma Tai-tai.&#34;&#34;I&#39;ve been busy--a family matter,&#34; Ma Tai-tai mumbled amid the twittering of the mahjong tiles.Yee Tai-tai&#39;s lips thinned into a smile. &#34;She went into hiding because it was her turn to buy dinner.&#34;Chia-chih suspected that Ma Tai-tai was jealous. Ever since Chia-chih had arrived, she had been the center of attention.&#34;Liao Tai-tai took us all out last night. She&#39;s been on such a winning streak the last couple of days,&#34; Yee Tai-tai went on to Ma Tai-tai. &#34;At the restaurant, I bumped into that young Mr. Lee and his wife and invited them to join us. When he said they were waiting for guests of their own, I told him they should all join us. After all, it isn&#39;t often that Liao Tai-tai gives dinner parties. Then it turned out Mr. Lee had invited so many guests we couldn&#39;t fit them all around our table. Even with extra chairs we couldn&#39;t all squeeze in, so Liao Tai-tai had to sit behind me like a singsong girl at a banquet. &#39;What a beauty I&#39;ve picked for myself tonight,&#39; I joked. &#39;I&#39;m too old a piece of tofu for you to swallow,&#39; she replied. &#39;Old tofu tastes the spiciest,&#39; I told her! Oh, how we laughed. She laughed so much her pockmarks turned red.&#34;More laughter around the mahjong table.While Yee Tai-tai was still updating Ma Tai-tai on the goings-on of the past couple of days, Mr. Yee came in, dressed in a gray suit, and nodded at his three female guests.&#34;You started early today.&#34;He stood behind his wife, watching the game. The wall behind him was swathed in heavy, yellowish-brown wool curtains printed with a brick-red phoenix-tail fern design, each blade almost six feet long. Chou Fo-hai, Wang Ching-wei&#39;s second in command, had a pair; and so, therefore, did they. False french windows, and enormous drapes to cover them, were all the rage just then. Because of the war, fabrics were in short supply; floor-length curtains such as those hanging behind Mr. Yee--using up an entire bolt of cloth, with extra wastage from pattern matching--were a conspicuous extravagance. Standing against the huge ferns of his backdrop, Yee looked even shorter than usual. His face was pale, finely drawn, and crowned by a receding hairline that faded away into petal-shaped peaks above his temples. His nose was distinguished by its narrowed, almost ratlike tip.&#34;Is that ring of yours three carats, Ma Tai-tai?&#34; Yee Tai-tai asked. &#34;The day before yesterday, P&#39;in Fen brought a five-carat diamond to show me, but it didn&#39;t sparkle like yours.&#34;&#34;I&#39;ve heard P&#39;in Fen&#39;s things are better than the stuff in the shops.&#34;&#34;It is convenient to have things brought to your home, I suppose. And you can hold on to them for a few days, while you decide. And sometimes she has things you can&#39;t get elsewhere. Last time, she showed me a yellow kerosene diamond, but he wouldn&#39;t buy it.&#34; She glanced icily at Mr. Yee before going on: &#34;How much do you imagine something like that would cost now? A perfect kerosene diamond: a dozen ounces of gold per carat? Two? Three? P&#39;in Fen says no one&#39;s selling kerosene or pink diamonds at the moment, for any price. Everyone&#39;s hoarding them, waiting for the price to get even more insane.&#34;&#34;Didn&#39;t you feel how heavy it was?&#34; Mr. Yee laughed. &#34;Ten carats. You wouldn&#39;t have been able to play mahjong with that rock on your finger.&#34;The edges of the table glittered like a diamond exhibition, Chia-chih thought, every pair of hands glinting ostentatiously--except hers. She should have left her jadeite ring back in its box, she realized; to spare herself all those sneering glances.&#34;Stop making fun of me!&#34; Yee Tai-tai sulked as she moved out one of her counters. The black cape opposite Ma Tai-tai clatteringly opened out her winning hand, and a sudden commotion of laughter and lament broke the thread of conversation.As the gamblers busily set to calculating their wins and losses, Mr. Yee motioned slightly at Chia-chih with his chin toward the door.She immediately glanced at the two black capes on either side of her. Fortunately, neither seemed to have noticed. She paid out the chips she had lost, took a sip from her teacup, then suddenly exclaimed: &#34;That memory of mine! I have a business appointment at three o&#39;clock, I&#39;d forgotten all about it. Mr. Yee, will you take my place until I get back?&#34;&#34;I won&#39;t allow it!&#34; Yee Tai-tai protested. &#34;You can&#39;t just run away like that without warning us in advance.&#34;&#34;And just when I thought my luck was changing,&#34; muttered the winning black cape.&#34;I suppose we could ask Liao Tai-tai to come over. Go and telephone her,&#34; Yee Tai-tai went on to Chia-chih. &#34;At least stay until she gets here.&#34;&#34;I really need to go now.&#34; Chia-chih looked at her watch. &#34;I&#39;m going to be late--I arranged to have coffee with a broker. Mr. Yee can take my place.&#34;&#34;I&#39;m busy this afternoon,&#34; Mr. Yee excused himself. &#34;Tomorrow I&#39;ll play all night.&#34;&#34;That Wang Chia-chih!&#34; Yee Tai-tai liked referring to Chia-chih by her full maiden name, as if they had known each other since they were girls. &#34;I&#39;ll make you pay for this--you&#39;re going to treat us all to dinner tonight!&#34;&#34;You can&#39;t let your guest buy you dinner,&#34; Ma Tai-tai objected.&#34;I&#39;m siding with Yee Tai-tai,&#34; the other black cape put in.They needed to tread carefully around their hostess on the subject of her young houseguest. Although Yee Tai-tai was easily old enough to be Chia-chih&#39;s mother, there had never been any talk of formalizing their relationship, of adopting her as a goddaughter. Yee Tai-tai was a little unpredictable, at the age she was now. Although she had a dowager&#39;s fondness for keeping young, pretty women clustered around her--like a galaxy of stars reflecting glory onto the moon around which they circulated--she was not yet too old for flashes of feminine jealousy.&#34;All right, all right,&#34; Chia-chih said. &#34;I&#39;ll take you all out to dinner tonight. But you won&#39;t be in the party, Mr. Yee, if you don&#39;t take my place now.&#34;&#34;Do, Mr. Yee! Mahjong&#39;s no fun with only three. Play just for a little, while Ma Tai-tai telephones for a replacement.&#34;&#34;I really do have a prior engagement.&#34; Whenever Mr. Yee spoke of official business, his voice sank to an almost inaudibly discreet mutter. &#34;Someone else will come along soon.&#34;&#34;We all know how busy Mr. Yee is,&#34; Ma Tai-tai said.Was she insinuating something, Chia-chih wondered, or were nerves getting the better of her? Observing him smile and banter, Chia-chih even began to read a flattering undertone into Ma Tai-tai&#39;s remark, as if she knew that he wanted other people to coax the details of his conquest out of him. Perhaps success, she speculated, can turn the heads of even the professionally secretive.It was getting far too dangerous. If the job wasn&#39;t done today, if the thing were to drag on any longer, Yee Tai-tai would surely find them out.He walked off while she was still exhaustingly negotiating her exit with his wife. After finally extricating herself, she returned briefly to her room. As she finished hurriedly tidying her hair and makeup--there was too little time to change her clothes--the maidservant arrived to tell her the car was waiting for her at the door. Getting in, she gave the chauffeur instructions to drive her to a cafe; once arrived, she sent him back home.As it was only midafternoon, the cafe was almost deserted. Its large interior was lit by wall lamps with pleated apricot silk shades, its floor populated by small round tables covered in cloths of fine white linen jacquard--an old-fashioned, middlebrow kind of establishment. She made a call from the public telephone on the counter. After four rings, she hung up and redialed, muttering &#34;wrong number&#34; to herself, for fear the cashier might think her behavior strange.That was the code. The second time, someone answered.&#34;Hello?&#34;Thank goodness--it was K&#39;uang Yu-min. Even now, she was terrified she might have to speak to Liang Jun-sheng, though he was usually very careful to let others get to the phone first.&#34;It&#39;s me,&#34; she replied in Cantonese. &#34;Everyone well?&#34;&#34;All fine. How about yourself?&#34;&#34;I&#39;ll be going shopping this afternoon, but I&#39;m not sure when.&#34;&#34;No problem. We&#39;ll wait for you. Where are you now?&#34;&#34;Hsia-fei Road.&#34;&#34;Fine.&#34;A pause.&#34;Nothing else then?&#34; Her hands felt cold, but she was somehow warmed by the sound of a familiar voice.&#34;No, nothing.&#34;&#34;I might go there right now.&#34;&#34;We&#39;ll be there, don&#39;t worry. See you later.&#34;She hung up and exited to hail a pedicab.If they didn&#39;t finish it off today, she couldn&#39;t stay on at the Yees&#39;--not with all those great bejeweled cats watching her every move. Maybe she should have found an excuse to move out as soon as she had hooked him. He could have found her a place somewhere: the last couple of times they&#39;d met in apartments, different ones each time, left vacant by British or Americans departed to war camps. But that probably would have made everything even more complicated--how would she have known what time he was coming? He might have suddenly descended upon her at any moment. Or if they had fixed a time in advance, urgent business might have forced him to cancel at the last minute. Calling him would also have been difficult, as his wife kept a close eye on him; she probably had spies stationed in all his various offices. A hint of suspicion and the whole thing would be undone: Shanghai crawled with potential informers, all of them eager to ingratiate themselves with the mighty Yee Tai-tai. And if Chia-chih had not pursued him so energetically, he might have cast her aside. Apartments were a popular parting gift to discarded mistresses of Wang Ching-wei&#39;s ministers. He had too many temptations jostling before him; far too many for any one moment. And if one of them weren&#39;t kept constantly in view, it would slip to the back of his mind and out of sight. No: he had to be nailed--even if she had to keep his nose buried between her breasts to do it.&#34;They weren&#39;t this big two years ago,&#34; he had murmured to her, in between kisses.His head against her chest, he hadn&#39;t seen her blush.Even now, it stung her to recall those knowing smirks--from all of them, K&#39;uang Yu-min included. Only Liang Jun-sheng had pretended not to notice how much bigger her breasts now looked. Some episodes from her past she needed to keep banished from her mind.It was some distance to the foreign concessions. When the pedicab reached the corner of Ching-an Temple and Seymour roads, she told him to stop by a small cafe. She looked around her, on the off chance that his car had already arrived. She could see only a vehicle with a bulky, charcoal-burning tank parked a little way up the street.</p><h2>In the Wilderness: The Master of Hestviken, Vol. 3</h2><p>It is Norway in the thirteenth century, a land rent by unremitting warfare and feebly lit by Christianity.

But it is also an original exposition of basic legal concepts that scholars and lawyers will find stimulating. It covers such topics as rules, precedent, authority, analogical reasoning, the common law, statutory interpretation, legal realism, judicial opinions, legal facts, and burden of proof. In addressing the question whether legal reasoning is distinctive, Frederick Schauer emphasizes the formality and rule-dependence of law. When taking the words of a statute seriously, when following a rule even when it does not produce the best result, when treating the fact of a past decision as a reason for making the same decision again, or when relying on authoritative sources, the law embodies values other than simply that of making the best decision for the particular occasion or dispute. In thus pursuing goals of stability, predictability, and constraint on the idiosyncrasies of individual decision-makers, the law employs forms of reasoning that may not be unique to it but are far more dominant in legal decision-making than elsewhere. Schauer&#x2019;s analysis of what makes legal reasoning special will be a valuable guide for students while also presenting a challenge to a wide range of current academic theories.</p><p>Frederick Schauer is David and Mary Harrison Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Virginia.&#x201c;This book will belong on every law professor's and law student's bookshelf&#x2015;and on many others' bookshelves as well.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lawrence A.

All of the bases are covered, and law students, teachers, practicing lawyers, and judges alike will gain perspective and insight from seeing the entire range of legal reasoning techniques laid out before them.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Richard A. Posner, Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, author of <i>How Judges Think</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Thinking Like a Lawyer</i> is by far the best available introduction to legal reasoning, of interest to law students and their teachers alike.

(Point/Counterpoint)</h2><p>One of today's most controversial and heated issues is whether or not the conflict between science and religion can be reconciled. In <em>Science and Religion: Are They Compatible?,</em> renowned philosophers Daniel C. Dennett and Alvin Plantinga expand upon the arguments that they presented in an exciting live debate held at the 2009 American Philosophical Association Central Division conference.<br><br>An enlightening discussion that will motivate students to think critically, <em>Science and Religion: Are They Compatible?</em> opens with Plantinga's assertion that Christianity is compatible with evolutionary theory because Christians believe that God created the living world, and it is entirely possible that God did so by using a process of evolution. Dennett vigorously rejects this argument, provoking a reply from Plantinga, another response from Dennett, and final statements from both sides. As philosophers, the authors possess expert skills in critical analysis; their arguments provide a model of dialogue between those who strongly disagree.

They originated in Yiddishland, a vast expanse of Eastern Europe that, before the Holocaust, ran from the Baltic Sea to the western edge of Russia and incorporated hundreds of Jewish communities with a combined population of some 11 million people. Within this territory, revolutionaries arose from the Jewish misery of Eastern and Central Europe; they were raised in the fear of God and taught to respect religious tradition, but were caught up in the great current of revolutionary utopian thinking. Socialists, Communists, Bundists, Zionists, Trotskyists, manual workers and intellectuals, they embodied the multifarious activity and radicalism of a Jewish working class that glimpsed the Messiah in the folds of the red flag.<br><br> Today, the world from which they came has disappeared, dismantled and destroyed by the Nazi genocide. After this irremediable break, there remain only survivors, and the work of memory for red Yiddishland. This book traces the struggles of these militants, their singular trajectories, their oscillation between great hope and doubt, their lost illusions&#x2014;a red and Jewish gaze on the history of the twentieth century.</p><p><b>Alain Brossat</b> is a Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Paris VIII and long-time activist. <b>Sylvia Klingberg</b> is a French sociologist.&#x201c;This rich and poignant and often enthralling record traces the Yiddishland revolutionaries from their East European roots through the years of hope and struggle and hideous crimes to the heroic anti-Nazi resistance and beyond, with fascinating asides on Spain and Palestine. There are many lessons for today, not least the significance of the lively interaction of revolutionary intellectuals and workers and the efforts to integrate the commitment to radical social and economic change with the formation of a Jewish identity that would break sharply from the stultifying tradition and open the way to the aspirations of the Jewish workers&#x2019; movement that was at the forefront of revolutionary struggle from its earliest days.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Noam Chomsky</b><br><br> &#x201c;Could there have been a future for pre-war Jewry in which Israel did not exist and Jews were gathered in a nation state within a federated Soviet Union? This is one of the questions brought up in Alain Brossat and Sylvie Klingberg&#x2019;s book ... There is hope for the spirit and aims behind the stories this book tells.

The gripping testimonies collected in these pages give the lie to the idea that Jews in the Shoah went like sheep to the slaughter.

Unfortunately, we have much less knowledge about the everyday life which preceded the horror and was so brutally terminated. For opening up this world we must praise Alain Brossat and Sylvia Klinberg for their vital new book, <i>Revolutionary Yiddishland</i>. Here, life is given priority to death, and the struggles of so many in the Yiddishland allow us to see past the catastrophes.&#x201d; <br><b> &#x2014;Shlomo Sand, author of <i>The Invention of the Jewish People</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Brossat and Klingberg&#x2019;s book is a memorial to a missing world.

Get ready for thrills, chills, and a chain-smoking professional squirrel, in this high-octane tale of the infestation of Earth by extraterrestrial interlopers and the motley crew of humans who save the world...sort of.<br></p></p><p><p><strong>Christopher Moore &amp; Ian Corson Discuss <em>The Griff</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a specific reason you decided to make <em>The Griff</em> a comic book instead of a novel?</p> <p><strong> Chris:</strong> The story came to me, partially, in a dream, and it was so visual and action-based that I didn&#x2019;t think it was appropriate for a novel. Most of my novels are character based, and with <em>The Griff</em>, the characters were going to be secondary to the bigger action. Initially I thought it would be appropriate for a film, which is where Ian came in.</p> <p><strong> Ian:</strong> After we&#x2019;d written the original screenplay, Chris and I talked about the idea of one day turning this into a graphic novel. Soon after, the comic book publishers reached out to Chris to write for them, so then <em>The Griff</em> graphic novel became a possibility.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What was the process like working with each other?</p> <p><strong> Chris:</strong> We work together pretty well, I think. I think we both have a very practical approach to the work and can just get it done without infinite discussion of details. I&#x2019;ve been in the room when other screenwriters are working together and it seems like they waste a lot of time hashing out every single element of the script, every line, and it&#x2019;s excruciating. With Ian and me it&#x2019;s like, &#x201c;Okay, you kill all these sons-a-bitches, and I&#x2019;ll write the next scene where they clean the blood off their hands.&#x201d; Then we just do the work. Ian did most of the liaison with the artist because I was on deadline for my next novel, <em>Sacre Bleu</em>, although we consulted on the changes we asked for nearly every day by phone.</p> <p><strong> Ian:</strong> Before I met Chris, I was a big fan of his work. When he wanted to collaborate it was a little intimidating at first. I kinda felt like Danny DeVito stepping onto the basketball court with Michael Jordan. Luckily, those inhibitions disappeared pretty quickly and Chris and I fell into a comfortable work relationship. It was a lot of fun and I&#x2019;m proud of the end result.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Who is your favorite character from <em>The Griff</em>?</p> <p><strong> Chris:</strong> My favorite character is Mo (short for Maureen), who is sort of a punky/gothy 20-something computer game designer with a snarky attitude. I like that even though she&#x2019;s never been in a life-and-death combat situation before, she understands strategy and weapons and she&#x2019;s not really afraid of anything. She&#x2019;s a great ad-hoc leader for the survivors and really was sort of the precursor for similar characters I would create for my vampire books and my novel, <em>A Dirty Job</em>, which is a comedy about Death.</p> <p><strong> Ian:</strong> I like Mo, too. It was a lot of fun to write for her, especially when she put Steve in his place. Steve is also a favorite character since he's a well-meaning doofus. It's probably a little too much information, but I can relate to him on some level. Plus we named him after Chris' goldfish at the time.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> As long as we're talking about comic books, if you could have any super power, what would it be?</p> <p><strong> Chris:</strong> I wouldn&#x2019;t mind Wolverine healing. And if you only had the healing thing, you wouldn&#x2019;t really be obligated to fight crime and stuff. Someone would be, &#x201c;Hey Chris, there&#x2019;s a super-villain on the Golden Gate bridge!&#x201d; And I&#x2019;d be like, &#x201c;Good luck with that, I can&#x2019;t even bench-press my weight. I&#x2019;m going to the library, where I have no fear at all of getting paper cuts.&#x201d;</p> <p><strong> Ian:</strong> Not sure about super powers, but Batman has some pretty awesome toys. He kinda wins in the car, boat and cave departments. He&#x2019;s also pretty good at kicking ass and apparently has no fear of heights. I wouldn&#x2019;t mind any of that but I&#x2019;d hate having to apply black makeup around my eyes for the mask.

The likeable Doc of <i>Stagecoach</i> (1939) had audiences on the edge of their seats with dire warnings about &#x201c;that old butcher, Geronimo.&#x201d; Old Lodgeskins of <i>Little Big Man</i> (1970) had viewers crying out against the demise of the noble, wise chief and his kind and simple people. In 1995 Disney created a beautiful, peace-loving ecologist and called her Pocahontas. Only occasionally have Native Americans been portrayed as complex, modern characters in films like <i>Smoke Signals</i>.<i></i>&nbsp;<i>Celluloid Indians</i> is an accessible, insightful overview of Native American representation in film over the past century. Beginning with the birth of the movie industry, Jacquelyn Kilpatrick carefully traces changes in the cinematic depictions of Native peoples and identifies cultural and historical reasons for those changes. In the late twentieth century, Native Americans have been increasingly involved with writing and directing movies about themselves, and Kilpatrick places appropriate emphasis on the impact that Native American screenwriters and filmmakers have had on the industry. <i>Celluloid Indians</i> concludes with a valuable, in-depth look at influential and innovative Native Americans in today&#x2019;s film industry.</p><p>Jacquelyn Kilpatrick, of Choctaw, Cherokee, and Irish descent, is a professor of English at Governor&#x2019;s State University in University Park, Illinois. Her articles have appeared in <i>Creative Screenwriting</i> and <i>Cineaste.</i>"This is a seminal study of how Native Americans have been portrayed in film since the start of the film industry in this country. . . . This is much more than a book for film buffs; it's about how stereotypes of Native Americans were created. As the book treats the evolution of film images of Native Americans, the reader may begin to appreciate it as a history of how white people have dealt with Native Americans, including how they have created popular stereotypes of them. . . . An elegantly thoughtful book."&#x2014;<i>Kliatt</i> (<i>Kliatt</i>)<br><br>"Any filmmaker seeking to present images draped in honesty should read this book. It is an absolute must."&#x2014;E.

She has appeared on the cover of Time Magazine, and is currently featured as a hero in the documentary "Waiting for Superman." This is the story of her journey from good-girl daughter of Korean immigrants to tough-minded political game-changer. When Rhee first arrived in Washington, she found a school district that had been so broken for so long, that everyone had long since given up.&nbsp; The book provides an inside view of the union battles, the school closings, and contentious community politics that have been the subject of intense public interest and debate ? along with a rare look at Rhee's upbringing and life before DC.</p> <ul> <li>Rhee has been featured in the documentary "Waiting for Superman"</li> <li>Rhee's story points to a fresh way of addressing school improvement&nbsp;</li> <li>Addresses fundamental problems in&nbsp;our current education system, and the politics of leadership</li> </ul> <p>The book includes an insert with photos from Rhee's personal and professional life, and an "exit" interview that sheds light on what she's learned and where the future might take her.</p></p><p><b>Praise for <i>The Bee Eater</i></b> <p>"An inspiration to all of us in the education reform movement, Rhee is a passionate and tenacious advocate for public-school children, particularly those in poor communities.

The author delves into Rhee's childhood (as the only Korean American in her graduating class in her Toledo, Ohio school), her first teaching job in a West Baltimore classroom (where she once ate a bee to the amazement of her students), her appointment as chancellor of Washington, D.C. public schools and her launch of Children First, her national advocacy group that draws on the tough lessons of Washington. While the book reveals Rhee's remarkable accomplishments, it also explores many of the fundamental problems in our current education system, the unpredictable politics ofleadership &#x2014; and her shortcomings. <p>When Michelle Rhee first arrived in Washington, she found a school district that had been so dysfunctional for so long that many had given up, choosing to blame race and poverty rather than poor instruction. There was no one being held accountable. The district central office had become an adult employment center, a place to deposit job seekers. Rhee was convinced that Washington's inner city students could achieve, but considerable obstacles stood in the way &#x2014; obstacles that needed removing.</p> <p>Guided by the principles of outstanding leadership, strict accountability, and the power of effective teaching, Rhee was determined to turn around the Washington, D.C. schools. Her encounters with community politics and long-simmering racial tensions, and her battles with central office bureaucrats and teachers' unions, were so extraordinary that her efforts were featured in <i>Time</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, and a lengthy PBS series.</p> <p><i>The Bee Eater</i> holds the promise of educational excellence for today's students and for tomorrow's school reformers.</p></p><h2>The Thing Itself</h2><p><p>Adam Roberts turns his attention to answering the Fermi Paradox with a taut and claustrophobic tale that echoes John Carpenter's The Thing.</p><p>Two men while away the days in an Antarctic research station.

Time is running out for the Peculiar Children. With a dangerous madman on the loose, and their beloved Miss Peregrine still in danger, it's up to Jacob Portman to channel his newfound abilities and defeat Caul before he loses his friends--and their world--forever. This action-packed adventure features all-new Peculiar photographs from times and places all over the world.<br></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of September 2015:</strong> When we last saw Jacob and his peculiar companions in <em>Hollow City</em> they were in the kind of danger that left me chewing my fingernails waiting for the next book to see if they make it out alive. <em>The Library of Souls</em> did indeed pull me off the previous cliff, but if you know Ransom Riggs and the <em>Miss Peregrine&#x2019;s Peculiar Children</em> series, you know there is more where that came from. As we&#x2019;ve come to expect, the third book in the series has an abundance of strange and absorbing black and white photographs that came from all sorts of places yet look as though they were created just for this particular piece of the puzzle&#x2014;at this point, the photos provide an undercurrent as critical to the overall flow of the story as the words themselves. I don't want to spoil the read so I won't tell you (as much as I'd like to...) about reversals and time loops, evil doers and acts of heroism that make up this tantalizing novel, but let me just say that I found the whole thing, from beginning to end, to be every bit as mysterious, surprising, and gratifying as I&#x2019;d hoped it would be.<em> --Seira Wilson</em></p>Ransom Riggs is the author of Miss Peregrine s Home for Peculiar Children (Quirk, 2011), a New York Times best seller with more than 2 million copies sold, the bestselling sequel, Hollow City (Quirk, 2013) and the final title in the trilogy Library of Souls (Quirk 2015).

The first work, The Philosophy of Jesus, explored philosophy in light of Jesus, rather than the other way around. The present work investigates the reception Jesus received both in His lifetime and continuously to the present time, not only from His enemies, but from His friends, a reception of shock, astonishment, even disgust.<br>Jesus-Shock shows the reasons why to this day the name of "Jesus" stirs up controversy, even revulsion, in polite society. In the true spirit of ecumenism, it also points the way toward a true rapprochement among His modern-day disciples.</p><p>Peter Kreeft teaches philosophy at Boston College.</p><h2>Classic Crimes (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>Dorothy Sayers called William Roughead &#34;the best showman who ever stood before the door of the chamber of horrors,&#34; and his true crime stories, written in the early 1900s, are among the glories of the genre. Displaying a meticulous command of evidence and unerring dramatic flair, Roughead brings to life some of the most notorious crimes and extraordinary trials of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century England and Scotland. Utterly engrossing, these accounts of pre-meditated mayhem and miscarried justice also cast a powerful light on the evil that human beings, and human institutions, find both tempting to contemplate and all too easy to do.</p><p>William Roughead (1870-1952) was born in Edinburgh, where he studied law and became an expert on criminology. Between 1889 and 1949 he attended every murder trial of significance held in the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh, publishing his accounts of them in a series of best-selling books. He held the legal title of Writer to His Majesty&#x2019;s Signet and was an editor of the Notable British Trials Series.<br><br><b>Luc Sante </b>is the author of <i>Low Life</i>, <i>Evidence</i>, <i>The Factory of Facts</i>, <i>Kill All Your Darlings</i>, <i>Folk Photography</i>, and, most recently <i>The Other Paris</i>.

Generally regarded as America's oldest book, the <em>Popol Vuh, </em>in fact, corresponds to our Christian Bible, and it is, moreover, the most important of the five pieces of the great library treasures of the Maya that survived the Spanish Conquest.</p> <p>The <em>Popol Vuh </em>was first transcribed in the Quiche language, �but in Latin characters, in the middle of the sixteenth century, by some unknown but highly literate Quiche Maya Indian-probably from the oral traditions of his people. This now lost manuscript was copied at the end of the seventeenth century by Father Francisco Xim�nez, then parish priest of the village of Santo Tom�s Chichicastenango in the highlands of Guatemala, today the most celebrated and best-known Indian town in all of Central America.</p> <p>The mythology, traditions, cosmogony, and history of the Quich� Maya, including the chronology of their kings down to 1550, are related in simple yet literary style by the Indian chronicler. And Adrian Recinos has made a valuable contribution to the understanding and enjoyment of the document through his thorough going introduction and his identification of places and people in the footnotes.</p></p><p><p><strong>Adri&nbsp;n Recinos</strong>-who made a new Spanish translation from the original Xim&#x201a;nez manuscript in Quiche after he had discovered differences, omissions, and changes in the text published by Brasseur de Bourbourg in 1861?is a distinguished diplomat as well as linguist, archaeologist, and ethnologist.

The evidence has long seemed incontrovertible: Life was merely a product of blind chance&#x2014;a cosmic roll of an infinite number of dice across an eternity of time. Slowly, methodically, scientists supplied answers to mysteries insufficiently explained by theologians. Reason pushed faith off into the shadows of mythology and superstition, while atheism became a badge of wisdom. Our culture, freed from moral obligation, explored the frontiers of secularism. God was dead. <br><br> "Glynn's arguments for the existence of God put the burden of disproof on those intellectuals who think that the question has long since been settled." &#x2014; Andrew M. Greeley<br><br>But now, in the twilight of the twentieth century, a startling transformation is taking place in Western scientific and intellectual thought. At its heart is the dawning realization that the universe, far from being a sea of chaos, appears instead to be an intricately tuned mechanism whose every molecule, whose every physical law, seems to have been design from the very first nanosecond of the big bang toward a single end&#x2014;the creation of life. This intellectually and spiritually riveting book asks a provocative question: Is science, the long-time nemesis of the Deity, uncovering the face of God? <br><br>Patrick Glynn lays out the astonishing new evidence that caused him to turn away from the atheism he acquired as a student at Harvard and Cambridge. The facts are fascinating: Physicists are discovering an unexplainable order to the cosmos; medical researchers are reporting the extraordinary healing powers of prayer and are documenting credible accounts of near-death experiences; psychologists, who once considered belief in God to be a sign of neurosis, are finding instead that religious faith is a powerful elixir for mental health; and sociologists are now acknowledging the destructive consequences of a value-free society. <br><br><b><i>God: The Evidence</i></b> argues that faith today is not grounded in ignorance. It is where reason has been leading us all along.</p><p>"Glynn's arguments for the existence of God put the burden of disproof on those intellectuals who think that the question has long since been settled."<b>&#x2014; Andrew M.

A Graded Reader of Biblical Greek was developed to make the transition easier. It takes beginning exegetes from simple to progressively more difficult biblical texts. Students can now learn New Testament Greek the way they would any other language: through a graded program. A Graded Reader of Biblical Greek applies an inductive method to learning intermediate Greek grammar. It provides a workable introduction to exegesis, word studies, and developing a large vocabulary; and it assists the student in preparing for class, allowing classroom time to be put to its most effective use. - Twenty Greek passages are presented in graded order. - Difficult and unfamiliar grammatical constructions are explained. - All words that occur fewer than 20 times in the New Testament are defined. - An "Exegetical Discussion" section helps the exegete gain a deeper understanding of the language. A Graded Reader of Biblical Greek is the result of ten years of use and refinement by the author in an actual classroom setting.</p></p><p><p>William D Mounce (PhD, Aberdeen University) lives as a writer in Washougal, Washington.

In this book, Susan Drake and Rebecca Burns address this issue by offering strategies for synchronizing standards across the disciplines. At the heart of the book is the KNOW/DO/BE framework, which teachers can use to ensure a curriculum that is both rigorous and relevant to K-12 students at all stages of proficiency. Among other things, this comprehensive framework allows teachers to * Map curricula * Scan and cluster standards * Develop assessments and guiding questions * Align integrated instructional strategies and assessments Though the authors draw much of their data from research on integration, their focus is on analyzing the real-life experiences of teachers who have successfully integrated their curricula in the service of accountability. The many benefits of this approach that the authors explore include lower absenteeism, fewer behavioral problems, and higher rates of homework completion. By combining case studies with a wealth of supporting research, Meeting Standards Through Integrated Curriculum offers teachers a user- friendly system for meeting standards while advancing broad-based learning.</p><p></p><h2>China in World History (New Oxford World History)</h2><p>Here is a fascinating compact history of Chinese political, economic, and cultural life, ranging from the origins of civilization in China to the beginning of the 21st century. Historian Paul Ropp combines vivid story-telling with astute analysis to shed light on some of the larger questions of Chinese history. What is distinctive about China in comparison with other civilizations? What have been the major changes and continuities in Chinese life over the past four millennia? Offering a global perspective, the book shows how China's nomadic neighbors to the north and west influenced much of the political, military, and even cultural history of China. Ropp also examines Sino-Indian relations, highlighting the impact of the thriving trade between India and China as well as the profound effect of Indian Buddhism on Chinese life. Finally, the author discusses the humiliation of China at the hands of Western powers and Japan, explaining how these recent events have shaped China's quest for wealth, power and respect today, and have colored China's perception of its own place in world history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Paul S.

Cobra (1972) recounts the tale of a transvestite named Cobra, star of the Lyrical Theater of the Dolls, whose obsession is to transform his/her body. She is assisted in her metamorphosis by the Madam and Pup, Cobra&#x2019;s dwarfish double. They too change shape, through the violent ceremonies of a motorcycle gang, into a sect of Tibetan lamas seeking to revive Tantric Buddhism.<br><br>Maitreya (1978) continues the theme of metamorphosis, this time in the person of Luis Leng, a humble Cuban-Chinese cook, who becomes a reincarnation of Buddha. Through Leng, Sarduy traces the metamorphosis of two hitherto incomparable societies, Tibet at the moment of the Chinese invasion, and Cuba at the moment of revolution. Transgressing genres and genders, reveling in literal and figurative transvestism, these two novels are among the most daring achievements of postmodern Latin American fiction.</p><p>Having translated Manuel Puig, Julio Cortazar, Adolfo Bioy Casares, Guillermo Cabrera Infante, and other notable authors, Suzanne Jill Levine is one of the most highly regarded translators of contemporary Latin American literature.

However, the chapter titles do not always provide enough clues as to the complete scope of the section. The subheadings that divide the material into short, manageable segments are more helpful. Readers may need to skim each chapter spread, noting the subheading, to locate needed information. The pages are full of colorful photographs, illustrations, time lines, artwork, and diagrams complete with well-written captions. The texts offer more information than textbooks, but still do not delve deeply enough into each civilization to provide information for more than a simple report. However, the visual artifacts from each civilization are sure to interest students. None of the books includes a bibliography. The same information can be found in <i>Ancient Egypt</i>, <i>Ancient China</i>, and <i>Aztec, Inca, and Maya</i> (all DK, 2000) in the "Eyewitness" series.<i>-Anne L.

(Acting Edition for Theater Productions)</h2><p>for 6 men, 4 women. Picture a charming home in the South. Into this peaceful scene put the prosperous, despotic Hubbard family-Ben, possessive and scheming; Oscar, cruel and arrogant; Ben&#39;s dupe, Leo, weak and unprincipled; Regina wickedly clever-each trying to outwit the other. In contrast, meet lonely intimidated Birdie, whom Oscar wed for her father&#39;s cotton fields; wistful Alexandra, Regina&#39;s daughter; and Horace, ailing husband of Regina, between whom a breach has existed for years. The conflict in these lives has been caused by Ben&#39;s ambition to erect a cotton mill. The brothers still lack $75,000 to complete the transaction. This, they hope, will come from Horace, who has been in a hospital with a heart ailment. Horace is beset by his relatives the first hour of his homecoming, but refuses to commit himself. Desperate, Leo and his father, Oscar, plan for Leo to take $80,000 worth of bonds from Horace&#39;s safe-deposit box. However, knowing that he is to be short-lived, Horace has his box brought to him. Discovering the theft, he informs his wife that he has willed the bonds to her. He promises to say nothing about the theft, calling it a loan. Cruelly, Regina recalls their unhappy married life, causing Horace to be stricken with a severe attack. Regina refuses to get his medicine upstairs, hoping that the effort of climbing may prove fatal. Horace collapses. Then Regina blackmails her brothers into giving her 75% of the business instead of their planned 33 1/3%, or she will reveal their theft.

Whether observing family values among the Stone Age Dani people, or sampling delicacies like saut�ed sago beetle and premasticated manioc beer, Cahill is a fount of arcane information and a master of self-deprecating humor.</p><p>Travel writing has been popular since Herodotus first jotted down his observations while journeying abroad. Now Tim Cahill adds <i>Pass the Butterworms</i> to the genre, and a welcome addition it is. As in his earlier books <i>Jaguars Ripped My Flesh,</i> <i>A Wolverine Is Eating My Leg,</i> and <i>Pecked to Death by Ducks,</i> Mr. Cahill chronicles his trips to the far-flung corners of the world. Part of this author's charm is his resolute Everyman persona--he is neither remarkably brave nor extraordinarily competent. This is a man, after all, who capsizes his sea kayak in still waters and describes his rock-climbing experience as "hanging from a rope affixed to a diaper, which I am wearing in the place where diapers are most often worn. . . ." <p> Not all of Tim Cahill's essays in <i>Pass the Butterworms</i> are comic, however. Perhaps the most memorable in the collection is "A Darkness on the River," Cahill's account of the senseless murder of a friend's son in Peru and its aftermath. And even his funniest tales have a bittersweet quality to them--the inevitable by-product of an outsider looking in.</p>author of Buried Dreams, Road Fever, and Jaguars Ripped My Flesh takes readers on journeys to areas as remote as the rivers of Honduras and the immense grassland of Mongolia to the stunning geysers of Yellowstone and the deepest jungles of Peru. Here Cahill dares readers to follow him into his world of danger and high-spirited zaniness.</p><h2>Unplugged Play: No Batteries. No Plugs. Pure Fun.</h2><p>From the joy of smearing glue on paper to the screaming delight of a bubble-blowing relay, kids love to play. In fact, it's every kid's built-in tool for experiencing the world at large. A parent-friendly encyclopedia, <i>UNPLUGGED PLAY </i>("A wonderful guide," says Daniel Goleman) offers hundreds and hundreds of battery-free, screen-free, chirp-and-beep-free games and fun variations that stretch the imagination, spark creativity, building strong bodies, and forge deep friendships...and keep kids busy at the table while mom or dad makes dinner.</p><p>Too much TV? Too many hours spent on video games? Tired of hearing "I'm bored"? The answer is here. <i>The Unplugged Play Book</i> celebrates the pleasures and virtues of old-fashioned play while addressing the growing concerns of parents who worry about the time their children spend in front of a screen.<br><br> Written by Bobbi Conner, the creator and host of <i>The Parent's Journal</i>, the long-running, award-winning public radio show, <i>The Unplugged Play Book</i> is the family bible of hands-on fun, a parent-friendly encyclopedia of over 700 games and variations, with not a screen, plug, chip, disk, or battery in sight. Here are games to play alone and games to play with siblings and friends. Games to play indoors and games for outside. Toddler games, ten-year-olds' games, and games for the whole family. There are craft projects, puppet ideas, music activities, card games, guessing games, plus loads of ideas for keeping little kids busy nearby. There's stuff to do with cardboard boxes, with balloons, with muffin tins, with paper grocery sacks. There's how to draw a sidewalk masterpiece in chalk, design a castle, organize a treasure hunt, make silly hats from plastic tubs, build forts and ramps for toy cars and trucks. And dozens of special-occasion games, including birthday party ideas, themes, and activities. Woven throughout are not only the reasons to play unplugged&#x2014;why it's essential for whole development, how it builds intelligence, encourages problem-solving and self-control, boosts creativity and inner strength of character&#x2014;but also invaluable help for parents, from lists of best toys (and gadgets turned into toys) to dealing with issues of sharing, shyness, party meltdowns, safety, and much more.Bobbi Conner created the award-winning nationwide public radio series<i> The Parents Journal </i>and hosted the program for twenty-four years.

He resides in Utah, in a happy little valley near the mouth of a canyon with his wife and four children. Brandon&#x2019;s greatest regret is that he has but one life to give for Gondor.Death Weavers CHAPTER<p></p> 1 <p></p> SHRINE<p></p> <br>Are there really ghosts here?&#x201d; Cole asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re called echoes,&#x201d; Hunter replied. &#x201c;But, yeah. Pretty much.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole, Hunter, Dalton, and Jace strolled along a flat, stone-lined path in the garden surrounding the Seven-Cornered Shrine. The bright afternoon sun, the sculpted hedges, the diverse flowers, the trellised vines, the shade trees, the trickling streams, the splashing fountains&#x2014;nothing in view suggested the presence of restless spirits.<br> <br>They had arrived in Necronum from Zeropolis by monorail a little before midday. The station straddled the border between the kingdoms, with the track ending scant feet from Necronum. It had felt strange to transfer from the comforts of a sleek monorail to the clattering confines of a horse-drawn coach, and served as a strong reminder how different the kingdoms could be from one another. The coach had brought them directly to the shrine, along with Mira and Joe, who had gone their own way just after the group reached the sprawling grounds.<br> <br>Watching Hunter, Cole could still hardly believe he had joined forces with his lost brother. Cole lacked memories of living with Hunter as his sibling back home in Arizona, but that made sense because Hunter had been taken to the Outskirts before him. When people went to the Outskirts, those left behind forgot them, just as Cole&#x2019;s parents and sister could no longer remember him. Hunter had shown Cole lots of photographic evidence that they had grown up together and had offered even more proof with the risks he took back in Zeropolis.<br> <br>Cole sometimes wondered how many people had been brought to the Outskirts over the years. If all who came here were forgotten, how could anyone ever make an accurate count? Dozens of kids were simultaneously abducted by slave traders when Cole came to the Outskirts. And Hunter had been captured on a separate occasion. How many other times had it happened? How many total people had been taken? Hundreds? Thousands? More?<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve actually seen a ghost?&#x201d; Dalton asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen plenty,&#x201d; Hunter said. &#x201c;The shaping in Necronum is built around interacting with the dead.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Think we&#x2019;ll see some today?&#x201d; Jace asked, not quite keeping the uneasiness out of his voice.<br> <br>Hunter clapped his hands and rubbed his palms. &#x201c;Not if we stay together. Echoes don&#x2019;t usually like groups. At least not at a shrine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then let&#x2019;s split up,&#x201d; Jace said. &#x201c;I want to hear Dalton scream.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How will you hear me if you&#x2019;re running all the way back to Sambria?&#x201d; Dalton scoffed.<br> <br>Jace huffed. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to be afraid of.&#x201d; He glanced at Hunter. &#x201c;Is there?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hunter shrugged. &#x201c;Not if you don&#x2019;t mind being haunted.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Haunted?&#x201d; Jace asked, looking a shade or two paler.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sometimes an echo will take an interest in you,&#x201d; Hunter said. &#x201c;Follow you around. Work mischief. Watch you sleep.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace was trying to nod, as if the information were expected, but he didn&#x2019;t look very comfortable. Cole didn&#x2019;t feel at ease either, but he still managed to enjoy the sight of Jace getting rattled.<br> <br>&#x201c;They can&#x2019;t touch us or anything,&#x201d; Jace said, as if confirming common knowledge.<br> <br>&#x201c;It depends,&#x201d; Hunter said. &#x201c;Not usually. There are plenty of exceptions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re just messing with us,&#x201d; Dalton said hopefully.<br> <br>Pausing on the path, Hunter closed his eyes, stretched out his arms, and took a deep breath. &#x201c;I smell dead people.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever,&#x201d; Cole said, glancing around just in case. On one side of the path, a row of fruit trees rustled in the soft breeze. Were they moving a little too much? In the other direction, a couple sat on a stone bench staring at a pond. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t mean those two?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hunter opened his eyes and regarded the pair on the bench. &#x201c;Normal people. But you&#x2019;re smart not to make assumptions here. At a shrine, the differences between a living person and an echo can be subtle.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They look like normal people?&#x201d; Dalton asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Most of the time we can&#x2019;t see echoes,&#x201d; Hunter clarified. &#x201c;Sometimes you might feel them. Not so much with your fingers. Your spine might tingle, or you might have the suspicion you&#x2019;re being watched. Pay attention to those feelings in Necronum.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you good at the shaping here, Aaron?&#x201d; Jace asked, using the alias they had agreed to adopt for Hunter. They had decided Mira needed a codename as well. Today she was Sally.<br> <br>&#x201c;They call it weaving,&#x201d; Hunter said. &#x201c;Short for death weaving, or echo weaving. I&#x2019;m not bad at it. The really talented weavers can summon echoes. They can see and talk to them when others can&#x2019;t. Some weavers can even travel to the realm of the dead. They call it the echolands.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How good of a death weaver are you?&#x201d; Dalton asked.<br> <br>Hunter shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m no expert, but I know some decent tricks.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Call an echo,&#x201d; Jace challenged.<br> <br>&#x201c;No need here,&#x201d; Hunter explained. &#x201c;In fact, it would bother them. At a shrine, echoes can appear to anyone. They might be a little transparent. Or they might look as solid as we do.&#x201d; He started walking again.<br> <br>&#x201c;What exactly should we do if we find an echo?&#x201d; Cole asked. &#x201c;We never really covered that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Get info,&#x201d; Hunter said. &#x201c;We need to find Honor and Destiny.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We have the stars,&#x201d; Jace reminded him. Mira&#x2019;s mother, Queen Harmony, could place stars in the sky to mark the location of her five daughters. She only did so in emergencies. Currently, Destiny and Honor both had stars in the sky, practically on top of each other.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure, but we want details,&#x201d; Hunter said. &#x201c;We know which direction to go, but we don&#x2019;t know how far. And it would help if we could learn exactly what happened.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The echoes will just tell us?&#x201d; Cole asked. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it risky if we let the wrong echo know who we&#x2019;re after?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hunter rolled his eyes. &#x201c;Be smart about it. Don&#x2019;t start by asking exactly what you want to know. Haven&#x2019;t you been to confidence lounges? Feel it out. The echoes who come here do it voluntarily. They want to interact with the living. They may want you to do favors for them. See if you can make a deal.&#x201d; His voice became hard. &#x201c;But no binding oaths.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d; Dalton asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like making a formal contract,&#x201d; Hunter said. &#x201c;Echoes only have real influence over the living if you give them power. The easiest way to get yourself in trouble is by breaking a promise you made to them. Especially a formal one. They call it a bound oath.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But we can bargain?&#x201d; Cole checked.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you keep it casual,&#x201d; Hunter said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make any official vows. And take care how much you say. Echoes use information as currency. Most would happily trade what they learn from you with others.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hunter stopped walking as they reached the intersection of two paths. &#x201c;Four directions,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;One of us will have to backtrack,&#x201d; Cole observed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not it,&#x201d; Dalton said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not it,&#x201d; Cole added reflexively.<br> <br>Hunter stared at Jace. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care either way. Do you want to go back?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go forward,&#x201d; Jace said.<br> <br>&#x201c;We have a few hours,&#x201d; Hunter said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll make us clear out after sundown. My understanding is that most of the action at this shrine happens out here on the grounds, so just roam and see what you find. Try to relax, and use good judgment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Try not to cry,&#x201d; Jace told Dalton.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have fun,&#x201d; Dalton replied with a smile. &#x201c;I bet this will be your lucky day.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole winced. As a Sky Raider, Jace had adopted negative superstitions about any wishes involving good luck. &#x201c;He means die bravely,&#x201d; Cole interjected.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know what he means,&#x201d; Jace said coldly. &#x201c;I make a joke and he tries to jinx me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hunter rubbed his forehead, as if he had a headache coming on. &#x201c;Jinxes? That&#x2019;s a crime now? Come on, guys, get it together.&#x201d; He turned and started back the way they had come.<br> <br>After a final glare at Dalton, Jace proceeded along the path.<br> <br>Folding his arms, Cole watched Jace walk away. Dalton lingered. &#x201c;Why do you always bug him?&#x201d; Cole murmured.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jace started it,&#x201d; Dalton said. &#x201c;Go ask him why he bugs me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole sighed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s had a hard life. He grew up here as a slave.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And my life has been so easy,&#x201d; Dalton replied, some heat in his tone. &#x201c;I got taken here as a slave. Ripped from my home. Just like you. Every second we stay with Sally, we risk our lives just like Jace does.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole thought about that. After venturing into a stranger&#x2019;s basement on Halloween, Dalton, Jenna, and a bunch of his friends had been taken here against their will. Cole had followed, trying to help, but got captured as well. He had met Jace and Mira after he was sold as a slave to the Sky Raiders. When the three of them escaped with Twitch, he found out that Mira was a princess and got involved helping her find her four exiled sisters.<br> <br>Nothing since coming to the Outskirts had made Cole happier than finding Dalton. It had been such a relief to reunite not just with a face from home, but with his best friend. In a strange, dangerous world, Cole now had somebody he could talk to and really trust. But ever since finding Dalton, Cole had felt torn about whether his top priority should be helping Mira or finding the other kids who were taken. So far he had compromised by trying to accomplish both goals at the same time.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean our lives are easier,&#x201d; Cole said.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what it sounded like,&#x201d; Dalton said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jace is kind of a jerk,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see that changing in the near future. He was always a slave. He never learned how to be normal. I know you&#x2019;re better than that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So we should let him walk all over us?&#x201d; Dalton challenged. &#x201c;How many times do I have to say this? If you let somebody take advantage of you, it gets worse, not better.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole shrugged. &#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;re right.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dalton glanced down the path to the left. &#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;ll go this way.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Take care,&#x201d; Cole said.<br> <br>Dalton hesitated. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t forgotten about Jenna?&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole froze, trying not to let his irritation show. How could he forget Jenna, his secret crush since second grade who had finally started to become his friend before they were parted by slavers?<br> <br>&#x201c;We know she&#x2019;s here in Necronum at the Temple of the Still Water,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not nearby. But we&#x2019;ll get there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dalton looked around to make sure they were alone. &#x201c;Right. We know where she is. We don&#x2019;t have to wander. We could go straight there. We&#x2019;re in Necronum. If we find Jenna, we could search for the Grand Shaper of Creon and maybe figure out a way to get home and stay there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole put his hands on his hips. By all reports, even if they managed to get home, nobody would remember them, and they would get drawn back into the Outskirts within hours. But Trillian the torivor had suggested it might be possible to change how that worked, and Cole refused to give up hope he might be right. After all, isn&#x2019;t that what shapers did? Mess with reality? And shapecrafters could tinker with the shaping power itself. Somebody had to know a way they could get home to stay. &#x201c;Are you saying we should ditch Sally?&#x201d;<br> <br>Dalton raised both hands innocently. &#x201c;Two of her sisters are already in trouble here. This is where Nazeem lives, the freaky guy who invented shapecrafting and who almost caught you in Junction. Things could get really ugly. I&#x2019;m sure Joe can help Sally meet up with lots of allies here. They&#x2019;ll be all right. Queen Harmony already told you where to find Jenna. I don&#x2019;t get the holdup. Why make Jenna wait? And after we find her, do we keep her in danger, or do we go look for a way home?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Grand Shapers are in hiding,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;How would we find the Grand Shaper of Creon without Sally? Staying with her gives us access to all the members of the resistance.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It also leads us into danger and turns us into targets,&#x201d; Dalton said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s complicated. I don&#x2019;t have all the answers. But sometimes I wonder if getting home still matters to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole frowned. Since embarking for Necronum, he had been especially focused on trying to find Mira&#x2019;s sisters Honor and Destiny. Mira&#x2019;s mother had warned him they were in serious danger. And then last night in Zeropolis, Mira reported that Honor&#x2019;s and Destiny&#x2019;s stars had appeared in the sky.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course getting home matters,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;But finding Honor and Destiny is really urgent right now. We know they&#x2019;re in trouble.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I get helping at this shrine,&#x201d; Dalton said. &#x201c;We just made it to Necronum. But what if Destiny and Honor turn out to be far from the Temple of the Still Water?&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole paused before answering. He felt torn. Would he walk away from Mira if she still needed him? It would be so good to finally see Jenna again. But if Jenna was relatively safe, and Mira was in big trouble, shouldn&#x2019;t he help Mira first? Dalton was waiting for a reply.<br> <br>&#x201c;With Nazeem around, and the High King still after us, this might not be the safest time to get Jenna. If we can help Sally defeat Nazeem and Stafford, everyone will be safer, including us. Plus, we&#x2019;ll have major resources to help find the other kids from our neighborhood who got taken, and extra help figuring out a way home. Do you think Jenna will want to go home without Sarah and Lacie? How many of the kids who were brought here can we leave behind? It would take years to find them all on our own.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dalton nodded pensively. &#x201c;Maybe we can&#x2019;t take on the job of finding everybody. Maybe that&#x2019;s too much. Maybe me, you, and Aaron find Jenna and try to get home. We&#x2019;d be lucky to pull off that much. Do we really have to fight a revolution and find all those other kids too?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;Leaving the others feels wrong to me. So does abandoning Sally. But I hear you. If we figure out a way home, I guess we could leave behind info on how to follow us. We could hope the other kids find their own way back.&#x201d;<br> <br>No longer looking him in the eye, Dalton stared over Cole&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;We have company,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Cole turned to find a teenage girl standing behind him, not much taller than him and rather thin. Her long brown hair hung mostly straight and was parted in the middle. She wore a lacy white top, a gray skirt, and sandals with wooden soles. Cole thought she looked about fifteen.<br> <br>&#x201c;There are no private conversations here, you know,&#x201d; the teen said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Apparently not,&#x201d; Cole replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;She just appeared,&#x201d; Dalton muttered.<br> <br>The girl giggled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Appeared?&#x201d; Cole asked, suddenly unsettled. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re dead?&#x201d; She looked perfectly tangible.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not dead,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I still have my lifespark. But, yeah, my physical body died. I live on as an echo.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mustering his courage, Cole tried his best to act casual. &#x201c;You look normal. How can we tell you&#x2019;re really an echo?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She appeared,&#x201d; Dalton reminded him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see it,&#x201d; Cole said.<br> <br>The teen reached out a hand. &#x201c;Touch my fingers,&#x201d; she offered.<br> <br>Cole extended his hand, hesitated, then passed his fingers through hers. The contact created only the faintest whisper of sensation.<br> <br>The girl&#x2019;s eyes widened, and she giggled. &#x201c;Did you feel that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A little,&#x201d; Cole said.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s unusual,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;By the way, it&#x2019;s poor manners to touch an echo unless we offer, so don&#x2019;t make it a habit. The others will be mad at me for warning you that you were being overheard, but I started to feel bad for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole glanced at Dalton. He couldn&#x2019;t believe they were talking to an actual ghost!<br> <br>&#x201c;How ma...</p><h2>Redistribution or Recognition?: A Political-Philosophical Exchange</h2><p>&#x201c;Recognition&#x201d; has become a veritable keyword of our time, but its relation to &#x201c;redistribution&#x201d; remains undertheorized. This volume remedies the lacuna by staging a sustained debate between two philosophers, one North American, the other European, who hold different views of the matter. Highly attuned to contemporary politics, the exchange between Nancy Fraser and Axel Honneth constitutes a rigorous dialogue on moral philosophy, social theory, and the best way to conceptualize capitalist society.</p><p><b>Nancy Fraser</b> is Loeb Professor of Philosophy and Politics at the New School for Social Research, Einstein Fellow of the city of Berlin, and holder of the &#x201c;Global Justice&#x201d; Chair at the Coll�ge d&#x2019;�tudes mondiales in Paris. Her books include <i>Redistribution or Recognition</i>; <i>Adding Insult to Injury</i>; <i>Scales of Justice</i>; <i>Justice Interruptus</i>; and <i>Unruly Practices</i>.&#x201c;A carefully wrought and provocative debate between philosophers with strong commitments to asking what a more just social life might be. This text will doubtless produce a spate of new and important scholarship in critical theory in its wake.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Judith Butler</b><br><br>&#x201c;In this exciting dialogue, Nancy Fraser and Axel Honneth do not simply explore with perfect conceptual rigor the analogies and tensions of the paradigms of &#x2018;equal distributrion&#x2019; and &#x2018;struggle for recognition.&#x2019; They also demonstrate why engaged theory matters for collective practice. Their speculative effort will set the agenda for transnational debates of vital importance.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Etienne Balibar</b><br><br>&#x201c;In this fascinating volume, two of the major theorists of our time battle it out over the question of redistribution versus recognition. The stakes are high: how might a critical theory of capitalist society be revivified in a manner that unites philosophy, politics, and social theory. This is engaged theoretical debate of the highest level.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Simon Critchley</b></p><h2>Long and Short Stitch Embroidery: A Collection of Flowers (Milner Craft Series)</h2><p>In this stunning, color-illustrated collection of floral embroideries, the author of <em>Redout�&#x2019;s Finest Flowers in Embroidery</em> introduces needleworkers to her unique long- and short-stitch &#x201c;needlepainting&#x201d; style of portraying flowers like a botanical painter. Five starter projects show novices how to create the illusion of brushwork in thread and use basic techniques, from preparing fabric and transferring designs to blocking and mounting. Sixteen easily achieved but challenging larger projects enable beginners and experts to bring to life meticulously detailed sunflowers, magnolias, bearded irises, an Icelandic poppy, roses, and more. With diagrams, full-size templates, and stitch directions included, this is a must-have for any embroiderer&#x2019;s library.</p><p>Trish Burr is a self-taught embroiderer who hungrily consumes all aspects of this fine craft. Through research and practice she has developed this individual technique of surface embroidery. Further details about Trish Burr and her books can be found on her website: http://www.trishburr.co.za/Feb 14 This book is a delight; the embroideries look real and are an inspiration. The flower projects have careful drawings showing how to produce such lifelike pieces. The text is clear and progression easy to follow. The silk shading is carefully explained. After the introduction there are chapters on materials and techniques and 2 pages of tips; the one to step back from the work and study it is very good, we all need to rest our eyes and think about the work in hand. The stitch glossary leads naturally into the tips on improving silk shading and needlepainting. The first 4 projects are simple flower designs where all you&#39;ve absorbed can be used. Progressively more complex designs test the stitchers ability to put onto operation all the author has explained. Years of teaching are obvious in the progression of projects and gentle text. The colour printing and profusion of flowers is also inspiring.

LeFanu</h2><p>Joseph Sheridan LeFanu (1814&#x2013;1873) is regarded by many critics as the greatest master of the English ghost story. A product of the decaying Anglo-Irish culture of the early and middle nineteenth century, he sums up in his work better than any of his contemporaries the fears and dreads that may haunt the sensitive individual. <br>The reasons for his preeminence are many. He was a remarkable craftsman, whose work has been admired by critics as varied as V. S. Pritchett and H. P. Lovecraft, Henry James and M. R. James. More imaginative and more perceptive than his contemporaries who worked in the same form, he achieved depths and dimensions of terror that still remain otherwise unexplored. And although he was Victorian in his dates, he was in many respects un-Victorian in his writing: his ideas looked both backward to the great supernatural tradition of Romantic fiction and forward to the modern age. LeFanu's work, unfortunately, has not been as well known generally as it should be. A few of his better stories have appeared often enough in anthologies, but much of his very best work has lain hidden, because of its inaccessibility. His contemporaries were more interested in his detective novels (including the unmatchable "Uncle Silas") and his realistic novels than in his supernatural work, with the result that many of his stories were neither reprinted in England nor ever printed at all in America. <br>The present collection contains such favorites as "Carmilla," "The Familiar," "Green Tea," and "Schalken the Painter," as well as much otherwise unobtainable work. There is, for example, the magnificent nouvelle "The Haunted Baronet," (reprinted for the first time from the fabulously rare "Chronicles of Golden Friars," which survives in perhaps less than a dozen sets), material from "The Purcell Papers," the practically unknown essay-story "An Authentic Narrative of a Haunted House," and nine other first-rate stories.</p><p>Le Fanu is a Victorian writer who, along with Edgar A. Poe before him, invented the unity of mood and economy of means that characterizes the modern horror short story. Jack Sullivan, in <i>Horror Literature,</i> maintains that "Le Fanu was more revolutionary than Poe, for he began the process of dismantling the Gothic props and placing the supernatural tale in everyday settings." These quietly elegant tales include a female vampire who predates Dracula, a vicar troubled by a spectral monkey, a cruel hanging judge who gets his due and many other fine portents and hauntings.Everett F. Bleiler, born in 1920, was an editor at Dover Publications where this book was originally published.</p><h2>The Victorian Fairy Tale Book (The Pantheon Fairy Tale and Folklore Library)</h2><p><p>From Robert Browning&#x2019;s <i>The&nbsp;Pied Piper of Hamelin</i> and William Makepeace Thackeray&#x2019;s <i>The&nbsp;Rose and the Ring</i> to Kenneth Grahme&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The&nbsp;Reluctant Dragon </i>and J.

He presents a detailed map of the steps involved in working through barriers that prevent us from recognizing the most essential nature of our true identity.</p><p>The third and final book in Almaas's Diamond Mind series, this 602-page tome reformulates the traditionally accepted definition of narcissism, positing it as the major barrier to self-realization--we are staring at reflections of ourselves thinking we are looking at the real self until we fall through the surface of the pond. Dissecting the nature of self to expose ego's mimicry, Almaas illuminates the relationship between the different approaches of various psychological and religious traditions, leaving no stone unturned in his search for "essence." Since the process involves transformation of the experience of identity, it exerts pressure on all levels of self-image, bringing up classically narcissistic issues. While the work appears therapeutic and, in fact, may have therapeutic value, its primary purpose is opening to deeper levels of self knowledge, which eventually becomes a participation in the dynamic unfolding of being human. A pivotal distinction expounded upon in <i>The Point</i> is that Almaas is not directing the reader toward some realization of immaterial spirit or psychological state but is engendering the emergence of a material soul, a palpable essence of being. <i>--Randall Cohan</i>A.

By the time he stepped down in 2013 and after posting an unprecedented 399&#x2013;25&#x2013;3 record, De La Salle was regarded as one of the great dynasties in the history of high school football. In Chasing Perfection, Ladouceur shares, for the first time, the coaching philosophies he employed at De La Salle. Far more than a book on the Xs and Os of football, this resource focuses on how Ladouceur created a culture based on accountability, work ethic, humility, and commitment that made his teams greater than the sum of their parts. This book not only includes details on the nuances of the game and the techniques that made the Spartans the most celebrated high school football team in history, it also has chapters on creating what Ladouceur calls an "authentic team experience," which include lessons as valuable in a board room as in a locker room.</p><p><b>Bob Ladouceur</b> was the head coach of the De La Salle high school football team for 34 years.

Its wide-ranging coverage of scholarship, its comprehensive philological aids, and its exceptionally thorough notes and glossary have ensured its continued use in spite of the fact that the book has remained largely unaltered since 1936. The fourth edition has been prepared with the aim of updating the scholarship while preserving the aspects of Klaeber's work that have made it useful to students of literature, linguists, historians, folklorists, manuscript specialists, archaeologists, and theorists of culture.</p><p>A revised Introduction and Commentary incorporates the vast store of scholarship on Beowulf that has appeared since 1950. It brings readers up to date on areas of scholarship that have been controversial since the last edition, including the construction of the unique manuscript and views on the poem's date and unity of composition. The lightly revised text incorporates the best textual criticism of the intervening years, and the expanded Commentary furnishes detailed bibliographic guidance to discussion of textual cruces, as well as to modern and contemporary critical concerns. Aids to pronunciation have been added to the text, and advances in the study of the poem's language are addressed throughout. Readers will find that the book remains recognizably Klaeber's work, but with altered and added features designed to render it as useful today as it has ever been.</p></p><p><b>R.D.

Weighing in at almost 650 pages, this intelligently selected compendium contains work from nearly every contemporary bestselling author, cult favorite, and hot up-and-comer in horror. The volume mixes a generous amount of well-written new fiction with classic reprints, several "Favorite Halloween Memories," an informative "Short History of Halloween" by Paula Guran, a well-chosen "Overview of Halloween Films" by Gary A. Braunbeck, and an equally useful "Reader's Guide to Halloween Fiction" by Stefan Dziemianowicz. Many of the authors contribute both a story and a Favorite Memory, and Ray Bradbury, to whom the volume is rightfully dedicated, contributes these and a poem.<p> No review can do justice to an anthology whose table of contents crowds three pages. But perhaps a taste of three stories will suggest the breadth and depth of the whole. Ray Bradbury's subtle "Heavy Set" considers what it might be like to be the mother of a muscular, disturbed, and exceptionally attached son. In the West Coast gothic "A Redress for Andromeda," Caitlin R. Kiernan presents a beautifully written consideration of the costs of a hidden secret. Artist Gahan Wilson proves himself also talented at fiction with "Yesterday's Witch," in which trick-or-treaters find the neighborhood witch isn't any such thing ... or is she?</p><p> <i>October Dreams</i> is highly recommended to all fans of horror and dark fantasy. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>Richard Chizmar is the World Fantasy Award-winning editor of <i>Cemetery Dance</i> magazine and numerous anthologies.

In 1968, he was overweight (190 pounds at 5'9") and out of shape. He began a personal fitness program that got him down to 135 pounds. Yet one day, while in a physical conditioning class in college, he found he couldn&#x2019;t reach much past his knees in a straight-legged sitting position. So Bob started stretching. He found he soon felt better and that stretching made his running and cycling easier.<br><br>The American fitness boom was just starting, and the millions of people who started working out were discovering the importance of flexibility in their fitness programs. After several years of exercising and stretching with Jean and a small group of friends, Bob gradually developed a method of stretching that could be taught to anyone. Soon he was teaching his technique to others. He began with professional sports teams: the Denver Broncos, the California (now Anaheim) Angels, the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Los Angeles Lakers, and the New York Jets. He also worked with college teams at Nebraska, UC Berkeley, Washington State, and Southern Methodist University, as well as other amateur and Olympic athletes in a variety of sports. He traveled around the country for years, teaching stretching to people at sports medicine clinics, athletic clubs, and running camps.<br><br>In the 1980s, Bob was a serious mountain runner and road biker. For ten years in a row he ran the Catalina Island Marathon in southern California, the 18-mile Imogene Pass run in Telluride, Colorado (which goes up over a 13,000-foot-high ridge), and the Pike&#x2019;s Peak Marathon. These days Bob spends most of his workout time on a mountain bike and hiking in the mountains above his house in Colorado, often going for 3 5 hour bike rides in the mountains, with occasional trips to Nevada. Though Bob works out a lot, he knows that training like this is not necessary for the average person to be fit. Through his travels, lectures, and workshops, he&#x2019;s kept in constant touch with people in all degrees of physical condition.<br><br><b>Jean Anderson</b> has a B.A. in art from California State University at Long Beach.

Mackinnon was born in Australia in 1963. He got hDiploma in Education and a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature, Linguistics and Anglo-Saxon from the University of Adelaide. His teaching career started at Westminster school, Adelaide, where he taught English and Drama for four years. AFter this time he traveled overland England by yacht, hitch-hiking, river-canoe and even horseback-spending a brief time in a Chinese prison after accidentally swimming into China and being attacked by Komodo Dragons, amongst other experiences.<br><br>In England he taught at Sherborne and Cheltenham before becoming Head of Drama at Ellesmere College, Shropshire, where he also taught English. From Ellesmere he launched his unlikely voyage aboard his dinghy Jack de Crow. He is currently teaching English and Drama at Geelong Grammar School in Australia where he also coaches sailing....[a] blend of high adventure, immeasureable charm and comedy... (<i>Latitudes &amp; Attitudes</i>)<br><br>...a wonderful idea for a book--a series of ever bolder improvisations...undertaken in praise of the spirit of adventure. (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>...one of the most original and entertaining books on sailing and voyaging to come out in years. (<i>Sailing</i>)<br><br>...the cavalier attitude, wit, and romanticism of this book are enough to capture the heart of any adventurer... (<i>WaterCraft</i>)<br><br>...will have you alternately laughing and shaking your head in disbelief at the brilliant insanity of the ill-defined quest. (<i>Cruising World</i>)<br><br>There are as many ways to live aboard as there are boats that float. Some sailors take a more Spartan approach. Mackinnon took this latter style to its perhaps illogical extreme, when he sailed a Mirror dinghy from Wales to the Black Sea. The Mirror is about 11 feet long, and is used primarily as a sail trainer by instructors who believe in giving students lots of strings to pull; it has a gunter mainsail, a tiny jib and a toy spinnaker. I can't imagine a less suitable vessel for a trip across Europe, but this voyage provided the material for a fascinating book.<br><br>The author borrowed the little boat from the secondary school where he had been teaching, intent on a brief holiday before leaving England. But, seduced by his initial success in battling down small brooks and drainage ditches to the River Severn, he continued on, powered only by oars and that small mainsail, wearing his trademark pith helmet. His achievements encouraged him...and even his frequent disasters proved motivational once he figured out ways to overcome them.<br><br>Eventually, he reached a port on the English Channel and discovered to his surprise that no one in a position of authority was inclined to forbid him from crossing. So away he went, and fortune preserved him despite a serious navigation error. Once across the Channel, it was clear sailing to the Black Sea. Over the course of this great adventure, he sailed or rowed through 12 countries and 282 locks.<br><br>Readers may be inclined to dismiss Mackinnon as the sort of amusing, colorful, harmless eccentric famously produced by England, although the author is not English. But there's more to it than that. In his miniscule boat, Mackinnon was not only close to the water, he was close to the hearts of those who saw him rowing his way east, and he was taken in, repaired, fed, and generally treated with great affection by those he met on his voyage.<br><br>Mackinnon has a pleasant outgoing personality, and he writes with the sort of stylish flair you might expect from a literature teacher. However, the smallness of his boat was probably the largest factor in attracting so much kindness from the strangers along his route. Sometimes he slept under a tarp on the damp floorboards, but more often he stayed with newfound friends. (<i>Living Aboard</i>)<br><br>"This amiable book is about what can, but probably should not, be attempted in a Mirror dinghy...The experience is by turns cheering and terrifying, but always met with humor and described with style...It's the sort of book people buy in quantities to give to their friends." (<i>Classic Boat</i>)<br><br>Loaded with self-deprecating humor and one giddy adventure after another, this fun account of Mackinnon's voyage is definitely for armchair travelers. as it is highly unlikely that anyone would be wacky enough to use this book as a guide to try a similar stunt. Highly recommended for all public libraries.

H. Gombrich Lecture Series, 7)</h2><p><p><b>From one of our most eminent and accessible literary critics, a groundbreaking account of how the Greek and Roman classics forged Shakespeare&#x2019;s imagination</b></p><p>Ben Jonson famously accused Shakespeare of having &#x201c;small Latin and less Greek.&#x201d; But he was exaggerating. Shakespeare was steeped in the classics. Shaped by his grammar school education in Roman literature, history, and rhetoric, he moved to London, a city that modeled itself on ancient Rome. He worked in a theatrical profession that had inherited the conventions and forms of classical drama, and he read deeply in Ovid, Virgil, and Seneca. In a book of extraordinary range, acclaimed literary critic and biographer Jonathan Bate, one of the world&#x2019;s leading authorities on Shakespeare, offers groundbreaking insights into how, perhaps more than any other influence, the classics made Shakespeare the writer he became.</p><p>Revealing in new depth the influence of Cicero and Horace on Shakespeare and finding new links between him and classical traditions, ranging from myths and magic to monuments and politics, Bate offers striking new readings of a wide array of the plays and poems. At the heart of the book is an argument that Shakespeare&#x2019;s supreme valuation of the force of imagination was honed by the classical tradition and designed as a defense of poetry and theater in a hostile world of emergent Puritanism.</p><p>Rounded off with a fascinating account of how Shakespeare became our modern classic and has ended up playing much the same role for us as the Greek and Roman classics did for him, <i>How the Classics Made Shakespeare </i>combines stylistic brilliance, accessibility, and scholarship, demonstrating why Jonathan Bate is one of our most eminent and readable literary critics.</p></p><p>A book, from the UK&#39;s leading Shakespeare scholar, which elucidates the Bard&#39;s complex relationship with ancient world, from which he took so much inspiration.<b>Jonathan Bate </b>is Provost of Worcester College and professor of English literature at the University of Oxford and Gresham Professor of Rhetoric at Gresham College.

There are unusual dishes such as the Cornish Onion and Apple Pie, and even recipes for fungi, from common field mushrooms to puffballs. She describes some delicious puddings, cakes and breads, including an exotic violet flower ice cream, an eighteenth century coconut bread and Yorkshire teacakes. The finely-executed line drawings that accompany many of the recipes are more than just beautiful; they inform the cook about different varieties and techniques of food-handling. </p><p>First published in 1954, FOOD IN ENGLAND was the bible of english cooks and had a deep influence on many contemporary cooks and food writers. It will undoubtedly attract a new generation of admirers.</p></p><p>Dorothy Hartley wrote numerous books on British culture and history, including the six volumes of Life and Work of the People of England. FOOD IN ENGLAND is now regarded as a classic of its kind, with a deep influence on many contemporary cooks and food writers.&#39;A classic book without any worthy successor - a must for any keen English cook&#39; - DELIA SMITH &#39;Dorothy Hartley&#39;s ingenious ideas were one of my first inspirations; they show that English food should never be dismissed as boring&#39; - JOSCELINE DIMBLEBY &#39;This is the best of all books on English food. First published in 1954, it has popped up in print at intervals ever since, always welcome, always finding new admirers. Dorothy Hartley described Food In England as being like &#34;an old-fashioned kitchen, not impressive, but a warm and friendly place, where one can come in at any time and have a chat with the cook&#34;. So it is; and like a good old-fashioned kitchen it&#39;s intensely personal and full of bits and pieces at first sight not directly related to the production of food but somehow essential to the character of the place. Writing when she did, Dorothy Hartley was perhaps one of the last food historians to have easy access to the living past and her book views the preceding thousand years of food in England as a continuous present, all the cooks of the past wandering in and out of her kitchen. Full of traditional recipes, historical information, regional kitchen lore, personal reminiscences, household hints, gardening tips and brewing instructions, illuminating quotations and beautifully illustrated with expressive line drawings, Food In England is unsummarisable, copious and generous. Just buy it. Nobody with any interest whatsoever in English (and Scottish and Welsh) food, or who has any concern in what might make Britain British, should be without it.&#39; - Robin Davidson, AMAZON.CO.UK REVIEW</p><h2>Drunken Botanist</h2><p>This quirky guide explains the chemistry and botanical history of over 150 plants, trees, flowers and fruits, showing how they form the bases of our favourite cocktails.

Bush nominated Ann Dunwoody as a four-star general in the US Army-the first time a woman had ever achieved that rank. The news generated excitement around the world. Now retired after nearly four decades in the Army, Dunwoody shares what she learned along the way, from her first command leading 100 soldiers to her final assignment, in which she led a 60 billion enterprise of over 69,000 employees, including the Army's global supply chain in support of Iraq and Afghanistan.<br><br>What was the driving force behind Dunwoody's success? While her talent as a logistician and her empathy in dealing with fellow soldiers helped her rise through the ranks, Dunwoody also realized that true leaders never stop learning, refining, growing, and adapting. In <i>A Higher Standard</i>, Dunwoody details her evolution as a soldier and reveals the core leadership principles that helped her achieve her historic appointment. Dunwoody's strategies are applicable to any leader, no matter the size or scope of the organization. They include lessons such as "Never Walk by a Mistake," a mandate to recognize when something is wrong, big or small, and to hold people accountable. Not only can this save billions for industry, it can<br>sometimes save the lives of soldiers and citizens. She also advises that "Leaders Aren't Invincible-Don't Try to Be": to be our best, we have to acknowledge our worst. And she encourages readers to "Leverage the Power of Diversity" by creating teams of people from different backgrounds to provide a broad range of ideas and devise the best-informed decisions.<br><br>With these and other guiding principles, <i>A Higher Standard</i> offers practical, tactical advice that everyone can use to lead and achieve with maximum success.</p><p><b>General Ann Dunwoody</b> is the former commanding general of one of the Army's largest commands, the US Army Materiel Command. Now retired, she offers strategic insights to companies and corporate boards. In addition to becoming the first woman in US military history to achieve the rank of four-star general, she was also the first woman to command a battalion in the 82nd Airborne Division and Fort Bragg's first female general officer. Dunwoody was also the first woman to command the Combined Arms Support Command.<br><br><b>AnnDunwoody.com</b><br>"General Dunwoody's book, <i>A Higher Standard</i>, provides inspiring military philosophy and on-the-ground leadership experience.

As this book shows, her commitment to and zeal for service haven't ended with her military retirement." Walter Isaacson, President &amp; CEO of The Aspen Institute and author of <i>The Innovators</i><br><br>"An amazing, uplifting story and an important one for us to learn from. Ann Dunwoody was our first female four star general, not because she was a great female soldier, but because she was simply a great soldier. She drove change blazing a trail through myriad challenges and did it with extraordinary wisdom courage, and a selfless commitment to soldiers.

A truly extraordinary story.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Tampa Bay Times</i>, 10/18/15</b><br> Though a memoir, the book is very much a manual for business leaders.

The rules she sets forth, learned and practiced through 38 years of unrelenting effort, though no guarantee of equal success, are surely a path to failure if their wisdom is brushed aside In short, this book ought to be required reading for every basic leadership class.&#x201d;<br><br><b>InfoDad, 5/28/15</b><br> Ann Dunwoody became the first four-star female general in United States history when President George W. Bush nominated her to that rank in 2008. It was a remarkable accomplishment just how remarkable becomes clear from A Higher Standard There is plenty that is uplifting in her story. She stands for values that many now consider old-fashioned but without which there might never have been a United States, certainly not one as powerful as the nation is today Dunwoody had a remarkable Army career, and a remarkably successful one; and her recounting of what she did and how she did it is engaging, involving and often fascinating.&#x201d;<br><br>"[Dunwoody's] insight into how to create good relationships with superiors, peers, and subordinates and to earn their trust and respect is invaluable."&#x2015;<b>Lead with the Left</b></p><h2>London Labour and the London Poor (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>Unflinching reports of London&#x2019;s poor from a prolific and influential English writer</b><p><i>London Labour and the London Poor</i> originated in a series of articles, later published in four volumes, written for the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> in 1849 and 1850 when journalist Henry Mayhew was at the height of his career.

Ensnared by the trappings of affluence, adrift in the emptiness of American prosperity, his characters find themselves in the midst of dramas that, however comic, pose profound questions about conformity and class, pleasure and propriety, and the conduct and meaning of an individual life. At the same time, the stories reveal their author to be a master whose prose is at once precise and sensuous, in which a shrewd eye for social detail is paired with a lyric sensitivity to the world at large. &#x201c;The constants that I look for,&#x201d; he wrote in the preface to&nbsp;<i>The Stories of John Cheever</i>, &#x201c;are a love of light and a determination to trace some moral chain of being.&#x201d;<br><br>Cheever&#x2019;s superlative gifts as a storyteller are evident even in his first published work, &#x201c;Expelled&#x201d; (1930), which appeared in&nbsp;<i>The New Republic</i>&nbsp;when he was only 18: &#x201c;I felt that I was hearing for the first time the voice of a new generation,&#x201d; said Malcolm Cowley, then an editor at the magazine.&nbsp;<br><br>Moving to Manhattan from his native Massachusetts, Cheever began publishing stories in&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker</i>&nbsp;in the 1930s, establishing a crucial if sometimes contentious relationship that would last for much of his career. His debut collection,&nbsp;<i>The Way Some People Live</i>&nbsp;(1943), was a book that he effectively disowned, regarding it as apprentice work; the best stories in the volume, as selected by editor Blake Bailey, are here restored to print for the first time, offering&#x2014;along with seven other stories that Cheever never collected&#x2014;an intriguing glimpse into his early development.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>By the late 1940s Cheever had come into his own as a writer, achieving a breakthrough in 1947 with the Kafkaesque tale &#x201c;The Enormous Radio.&#x201d; It was soon followed by works of startling fluency and power, such as the unsettling &#x201c;Torch Song,&#x201d; with its suggestion of menace and the uncanny, as well as the searing, beautiful treatment of fraternal conflict, &#x201c;Goodbye, My Brother.&#x201d;<br><br>Finally, when Cheever and his family moved to Westchester County in the 1950s, he began writing about the disappointments of postwar suburbia in such definitive classics as &#x201c;The Sorrows of Gin,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Five-Forty-Eight,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Country Husband,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Swimmer.&#x201d;<br><br>This volume, published to coincide with Blake Bailey&#x2019;s groundbreaking biography, is the largest collection of Cheever&#x2019;s stories ever published, and celebrates his indelible achievement by gathering the complete&nbsp;<i>Stories of John Cheever</i>&nbsp;(1978), as well as seven stories from&nbsp;<i>The Way Some People Live</i>&nbsp;and seven additional stories first published in periodicals between 1930 and 1953.

And when a second Grenville West comes to light, Wexford faces a dizzying array of possible scenarios--and suspects--behind the Comfrey murder. <br><br>Brilliantly entertaining, exceptionally crafted, <b>A Sleeping Life</b> evokes the dark realities, half-truths, and flights of fancy that constitute a life.</p><p>Ruth Rendell is the author of <b>Road Rage</b>, <b>The Keys to the Street</b>, <b>Bloodlines</b>, <b>Simisola</b>, and <b>The Crocodile Bird</b>. She is the winner of the Mystery Writers of America Grand Master Award.

She lives in England.1<br><br>Home early for once. Maybe he'd start getting home early regularly now August had begun, the silly season. Criminals as well as the law-abiding take their holidays in August. As he turned the car into his own road, Wexford remembered his grandsons would be there. Good. It would be light for another three hours, and he'd take Robin and Ben down to the river. Robin was always on about the river because his mother had read <i>The Wind in the Willows</i> to him, and his great desire was to see a water rat swimming.<br><br>Sylvia's car was parked outside the house. Odd, thought Wexford. He'd understood Dora was having the boys for the afternoon as well as the evening and that they'd be staying the night. As he edged his own car past his daughter's into the drive, she came running out of the house with a screaming Ben in her arms and six-year-old Robin looking truculent at her heels. Robin rushed up to his grandfather.<br><br>"You promised we could see the water rat!"<br><br>"So you can as far as I'm concerned and if there's one about. I thought you were staying the night."<br><br>Sylvia's face was crimson, with rage or perhaps just from haste. It was very hot.<br><br>"Well, they're not. Thanks to my dear husband, nobody's going anywhere even though it does happen to be our wedding anniversary. Will you shut up, Ben! He's bringing a client home for dinner instead, if you please, and I, of course, as usual have to be the one to do the cooking and fetch the kids."<br><br>"Leave them here," said Wexford. "Why not?"<br><br>"Yes, leave us here," Robin shouted. "<i>Go on</i>."<br><br>"Oh, no, that's out of the question. Why do you have to encourage them, Dad? I'm taking them home and Neil can have the pleasure of putting them to bed for once."<br><br>She thrust both children into the car and drove off. The windows of the car were all open, and the yells of the two little boys, for Robin had begun to back his brother up, vied with the roar of the ill-treated engine. Wexford shrugged and went indoors. Some sort of scene had evidently been taking place, but he knew his wife better than to suppose she would be much disturbed by it. True to his expectations, she was sitting placidly in the living room watching the tail end of a children's programme on television. A great many books had been pulled out of the shelves, and on a tower block of them sat a Teddy bear.<br><br>"What's got into Sylvia?"<br><br>"Women's Lib," said Dora Wexford. "If Neil wants to bring a client home he ought to cook the meal. He ought to come home in the afternoon and clean the house and lay the table. She's taken the children home for the sole purpose of getting him to put them to bed. And she's taking care to stir them up on the way to make sure he has a hard time of it."<br><br>"God. I always thought she was quite a sensible girl."<br><br>"She's got a bee in her bonnet about it. It's been going on for months. You are the people, we are the others. You are the masters, we are the chattels."<br><br>"Why haven't you told me about any of this?"<br><br>Dora switched off the television. "You've been busy. You wouldn't have wanted to listen to all this nonsense when you got home. I've been getting it every day."<br><br>Wexford raised his eyebrows. "It's nonsense?"<br><br>"Well, not entirely, of course. Men still do have a better time of it in this world than women, it's still a man's world. I can understand she doesn't like being stuck at home with the boys, wasting her life, as she puts it, while Neil gets more and more successful in his career." Dora smiled. "And she says she got more A Levels than he did. I can understand she gets bored when people come and the men talk to Neil about architecture and the women talk to her about polishing the bedroom furniture. Oh, I can <i>understand</i> it."<br><br>Her husband looked hard at her. "You feel that way too?"<br><br>"Never you mind," said Dora, laughing now. "Let's forget our rather tiresome child. You're so early we might go out somewhere after we've eaten. Would you like to?"<br><br>"Love to." He hesitated, said quickly, "It's not threatening their marriage, is it? I've always thought of them as being so happy together."<br><br>"We have to hope it'll pass. Anything we do or say would only make things worse, wouldn't it?"<br><br>"Of course. Now where shall we go? Cinema? Or how about the open-air theatre at Sewingbury?"<br><br>Before she could give him an answer, the phone rang.<br><br>"Sylvia," she said. "She's realised Ben left his Teddy. You get it, darling. Oh, and Reg . . . ? Would you say we'll drop it on our way? I can't stand another session of the wounded wives tonight."<br><br>Wexford lifted the receiver. It wasn't his daughter. Dora knew it wasn't even before he spoke. She knew that look. All he said was "Yes" and "Sure, I will," but she knew. He hung up and said, "They don't all go on holiday in August. A body in a field not half a mile from here."<br><br>"Is it . . . ?"<br><br>"Not one of the people," said her husband dryly. "One of the others." He tightened the tie he had loosened, rolled down his shirtsleeves. "I'll have to go straightaway. What'll you do? Stir up the telly so I have a hard time of it putting it to rights? You must regret marrying me."<br><br>"No, but I'm working on it."<br><br>Wexford laughed, kissed her and drove back the way he had come.<br><br>Kingsmarkham is a sizeable town somewhere in the middle of Sussex, much built-up now on the Stowerton and Sewingbury sides, though open unspoilt country still remains at its northern end. There the High Street becomes the Pomfret Road, and there the pinewoods of Cheriton Forest clothe the hills.<br><br>Forest Road is the last street in the area to bear the postal address Kingsmarkham. It debouches directly from the Pomfret Road, but to reach it most of its few residents take the short cut from the end of the High Street by footpath across a field. Wexford parked his car at the point in Forest Road where this footpath entered it as an alley near the boundary fence of a pair of houses called Carlyle Villas. He swung into the alley and followed the footpath along a high privet hedge that bounded allotments. About a hundred yards ahead of him he could see a group of men gathered at the edge of a little copse.<br><br>Inspector Michael Burden was among them and so was Dr. Crocker, the police doctor, and a couple of photographers. As Wexford approached, Burden came up to him and said something in a low voice. Wexford nodded. Without looking at the body, he went up to Constable Loring who stood a little apart with a young man who looked pale and shaken.<br><br>"Mr. Parker?"<br><br>"That's right."<br><br>"I understand you found the body?"<br><br>Parker nodded. "Well, my son did."<br><br>He couldn't have been more than twenty-five himself.<br><br>"A <i>child</i>?" said Wexford.<br><br>"He doesn't realise. I hope not. He's only six."<br><br>They sat down on a wooden seat the council had put there for pensioners to rest on. "Tell me what happened."<br><br>"I'd taken him round to my sister's, give the wife a bit of a break while she was putting the other two to bed. I live in one of the bungalows in Forest Road, Bella Vista, the one with the green roof. We were coming back, along the path here, and Nicky was playing with a ball. It went in the long grass under the hedge and he went to look for it. He said, 'Dad, there's a lady down there.' I sort of knew, I don't know how. I went and looked and I&#x2014;well, I know I shouldn't have, but I sort of pulled her coat over her chest. Nicky, you see, he's only six, and there was&#x2014;well, blood, a mess."<br><br>"I do see," said Wexford. "You didn't move anything else?"<br><br>Parker shook his head. "I told Nicky the lady was ill and we'd go home and phone the doctor. I said she'd be all right. I don't think he realised. I hope not. I got him home and phoned your people. Honestly, I wouldn't have touched her if I'd been on my own."<br><br>"This was an exception, Mr. Parker." Wexford smiled at him. "I'd have done the same in your place."<br><br>"He won't have to . . . ? I mean, there'll be an inquest, won't there? I mean, I'll have to go, I know that, but . . ."<br><br>"No, no. Good God, no. Get off home now and well see you again later. Thanks for your help."<br><br>Parker got up off the seat, glanced at the photographers, the huddle round the body, then turned round. "It's not for me to . . . well, I mean, I do know who she is. Perhaps you don't . . ."<br><br>"No, we don't yet. Who is she?"<br><br>"Well, a Miss Comfrey. She didn't actually live here, her dad lives here." Parker pointed back down the path. "Carlyle Villas, the one with the blue paint. She must have been stopping there. Her dad's in hospital. He's an old man, he broke his hip, and she must have come down to see him."<br><br>"Thanks, Mr. Parker."<br><br>Wexford crossed the sandy path, and Burden stepped aside for him to look down at the body. It was that of a middle-aged woman, biggish and gaunt. The face was coated with heavy make-up, clotted scarlet on the mouth, streaky blue on the crepe eyelids, a ghastly ochreish layer on the planes of cheek and forehead. The grey eyes were wide and staring, and in them Wexford thought he saw&#x2014;it must be his imagination&#x2014;a sardonic gleam, a glare, even in death, of scorn.<br><br>A fringe of dark hair just showed under a tightly tied blue headscarf. The body was clothed in a blue-and-pink printed dress of some synthetic material, and the matching jacket, which had no fastenings, had been drawn across the bodice. One of the high-heeled shoes had come off and hung suspended on a tangle of brambles. Across the hips lay a large scarlet handbag. There were no rings on the hands, no watch on either wrist, but a heavy necklace of red glass beads round the neck, and the nails, though short, were painted the same scarlet.<br><br>He knelt down and opened the handbag, covering his fingers with his handkerchief. Inside was a key ring with three keys on it, a box of matches, a packet of king-size cigarettes from which four had been smoked, a lipstick, an old-fashioned powder compact, a wallet, in the bottom of the bag some loose change. No purse. No letters or documents. The wallet, which was an expensive new one of black leather, contained forty-two pounds. She hadn't been killed for the money she had on her.<br><br>There was nothing to give him a clue to her address, her occupation or even her identity. No credit card, no bank card, no cheque book.<br><br>He closed the bag and parted her jacket The bodice of the dress was black with clotted blood, but plainly discernible in the dark matted mass were two cuts, the outward evidence of stab wounds.<br><br>2<br><br>Wexford moved away, and the doctor came back and knelt where he had knelt. He said to Loring,<br><br>"No sign of the weapon, I dare say?"<br><br>"No, sir, but we haven't made much of a search yet."<br><br>"Well, get searching, you and Gates and Marwood. A knife of some sort." The chances of its being there, he thought pessimistically, were slight. "And when you haven't found it," he said, "you can do a house-to-house down Forest Road. Get all you can about her and her movements, but leave Parker and Carlyle Villas to me and Mr. Burden."<br><br>Back to Dr. Crocker.<br><br>"How long has she been dead, Len?"<br><br>"Now, for God's sake, don't expect too much precision at this stage. Rigor's fully established, but the weather's been very hot, so its onset will have been more rapid. I'd say at least eighteen hours. Could be more."<br><br>"O.K." Wexford jerked his head at Burden. "There's nothing more here for us, Mike. Carlyle Villas and Parker next, I think."<br><br>Michael Burden was properly of too high a rank to accompany a chief inspector on calls of enquiry. He did so because that was the way they worked, the way it worked. They had always done so, and always would, in spite of disapproving mutterings from the Chief Constable.<br><br>Two tall men. Nearly twenty years separated them, and once they had been so dissimilar in appearance as to provide that juxtaposition of incongruities which is the stuff of humour. But Wexford had lost his abundant fat and become almost a gaunt man, while Burden had always been lean. He was the better looking of the two by far, with classical features that would have been handsome had they been less pinched by sour experience. Wexford was an ugly man, but his was the face that arrested the eye, compelled even the eyes of women, because it had in it so much lively intelligence and zest for life, so much vigour, and in spite of his seniority, so much more of the essence of youth.<br><br>Side by side, they walked along the footpath and down the alley into Forest Road, not speaking, for there was nothing yet to say. The woman was dead, but death by murder is in a way not an end but a beginning. The lives of the naturally dead may be buried with them. Hers would now gradually be exposed, event after event, obscure though she had been, until it took on the character of a celebrity's biography.<br><br>From the alley, they turned to the right and stood outside the pair of houses, cottages really, in front of which Wexford had parked his car. The houses shared a single gable, and in its apex was a plaster plaque bearing their name and the date of their construction: Carlyle Villas, 1902. Wexford knocked at the blue front door with little hope of getting an answer. There was none, and no one came when they rang the bell on the neighbouring front door, a far more trendy and ambitious affair of wrought iron and reeded glass.<br><br>Frustrated at this most promising port of call, they crossed the street. Forest Road was a cul-de-sac, ending in a stone wall, behind which meadows swelled and the forest sprawled. It contained about a dozen houses, apart from Carlyle Villas, a clutch of tiny cottages at the wall end, two or three newer bungalows, a squat grey stone lodge that had once stood at the gates of a long-vanished mansion. One of the bungalows, built at the period when Hollywood's influence penetrated even this corner of Sussex, had windows of curved glass and a roof of green pantiles. Bella Vista.<br><br>The child Nicky was still up, sitting with his mother in a living room that had the same sort of untidy look as the one Wexford had left an hour before. But if Parker hadn't introduced this girl as his wife, Wexford would have taken her for no more than an adolescent. She had the smooth brow and bunchy checks of a child, the silken hair, the innocent eyes. She must have been married at sixteen, though she looked no more than that now.<br><br>Parker said with ferocious winks, "This gentleman's a doctor, come to tell us the poor lady's all right."<br><br>Nicky buried his face in his mother's shoulder.<br><br>"Quite all right," Wexford lied. "She'll be fine." They say the dead are well . . .<br><br>"You get along to Nanna's room then, Nicky, and she'll let you watch her T.V."<br><br>The tension lightened on his departure. "Thanks," said Parker. "I only hope it isn't going to have a bad effect on him, poor kid."<br><br>"Don't worry. He's too young to see newspapers, but you'll have to exercise a bit of censorship when it comes to the T.V. Now, Mr. Parker, I think you said Miss&#x2014;er&#x2014;Comfrey's father was in hospital. D'you know which hospital?"<br><br>"Stowerton. The infirmary. He had an accident last&#x2014;when would it have been, Stell?"<br><br>"About May," said Stella Parker. "Miss Comfrey came down to see him, came in a taxi from the station, and when he saw her he rushed out of the house and fell over on the path and broke his hip. Just like that it happened. Her and the taximan, they took him to the hospital in the same taxi, and he's been there ever since. I never saw it. Mrs. Crown told me. Miss Comfrey'd been down once to see him since. She never did come much, did she, Brian?"<br><br>"Not more than once or twice a yea...</p><h2>The Lost Gutenberg: The Astounding Story of One Book&#39;s Five-Hundred-Year Odyssey</h2><p><b><b>&#x201c;A lively tale of historical innovation, the thrill of the bibliophile&#x2019;s hunt, greed and betrayal.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2013;<i>&nbsp;The&nbsp;New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"An addictive and engaging look at the &#x2018;competitive, catty and slightly angst-ridden&#x2019; heart of the world of book collecting.&#x201d; - <i>The Houston Chronicle&nbsp;</i><br><br>The never-before-told story of one extremely rare copy of the Gutenberg Bible, and its impact on the lives of the fanatical few who were lucky enough to own it.</b></b><br><br>For rare-book collectors, an original copy of the Gutenberg Bible--of which there are fewer than 50 in existence--represents the ultimate prize.

And what is a human life, if, in every one of its gestures, of its words, and of its silences, it cannot be distinguished from the rule? It is to these questions that Agamben&#39;s new book turns by means of an impassioned reading of the fascinating and massive phenomenon of Western monasticism from Pachomius to St. Francis. The book reconstructs in detail the life of the monks with their obsessive attention to temporal articulation and to the Rule, to ascetic techniques and to liturgy. But Agamben&#39;s thesis is that the true novelty of monasticism lies not in the confusion between life and norm, but in the discovery of a new dimension, in which &#34;life&#34; as such, perhaps for the first time, is affirmed in its autonomy, and in which the claim of the &#34;highest poverty&#34; and &#34;use&#34; challenges the law in ways that we must still grapple with today. How can we think a form-of-life, that is, a human life released from the grip of law, and a use of bodies and of the world that never becomes an appropriation? How can we think life as something not subject to ownership but only for common use?</p><p>Giorgio Agamben, an Italian philosopher and political theorist, teaches at the IUAV University in Venice and holds the Baruch Spinoza Chair at the European Graduate School. His most recent book available in English from Stanford University Press is <i>The Kingdom and the Glory</i> (2011)."Like much of Agamben's writing, <i>The Highest Poverty</i> mixes historical, philosophical, and philological discourse with impressive skill. Agamben's book provokes insight through juxtaposition, analogy, and acts of theoretical imagination." (Brian Britt <i><i>Journal of Religion</i></i>)<br><br>"Agamben's work remains a thought-provoking and tightly written tract, and a number of trenchant observations can be found therein. For scholars of monasticism, <i>The Highest Poverty</i> will present old texts in productive new lights, and for scholars of philosophy and other disciplines, it will suggest new methods and tools that can be transposed into different fields of study." (Joshua Campbell <i><i>Journal of Medieval Monastic Studies</i></i>)<br><br>"The range of primary sources Agamben relies on to make his argument . . . is impressively vast. As his readers have come to expect, Agamben demonstrates an uncanny ability to discover enduring significance in obscure corners of the Western tradition while doing justice to their proper historicity." (Brian Hamilton <i><i>Modern Theology</i></i>)<br><br>"At a time when current anthropological debate has turned toward ontology, this book challenges us to return anew to questions of habits and habitus. <i>The Highest Poverty</i> offers a productive . . . lens through which to examine modernity, its antecedents, and its reimagined futures in the global South. Especially salient for anthropologists is the book's attention to theories of practice and a common life not wholly defined by the logics of capital and formal institutions." (Kerry Chance)<br><br>"<i>The Highest Poverty</i> is Agamben's attempt to define what he calls a 'form-of-life,' a mode of living where life and law enter into a zone of indistinction so that one is not able to discern between living according to the law and applying the law to a pre-existing life . . . The first thing that became quite clear in reading this book is the depth of knowledge and understanding Agamben has of monastic history as well as medieval philosophy and theology. He knows the literature, the languages, and the nuances needed for any depth of understanding . . . This book was not written for the spiritual or theological nourishment of monastics and friars. It was written as a piece of political philosophy concerned about the current all-consuming nature of law and what that does to life. Nevertheless, there is a great deal that monastics and friars can learn from the work of Agamben. He shows us a picture of ourselves from a vantage point that we seldom see. There is more to our form-of-life than immediately meets the eye." (Eugene Hensell)<br><br>"[I]t deepens the insights of Agamben's earlier work and extends them into the theological realm. . . .

The maiden Britomart, Queen Elizabeth's fictional ancestor, dons armor to search for a man whom she has seen in a crystal ball. While on this quest, she seeks to understand how one can be chaste while pursuing a sexual goal, in love with a man while passionately attached to a woman, a warrior princess yet a wife. As Spenser's most sensitively developed character, Britomart is capable of heroic deeds but also of teenage self-pity. Her experience is anatomized in the stories of other characters, where versions of love and friendship include physical gratification, torture, mutual aid, competition, spiritual ecstasy, self-sacrifice, genial teasing, jealousy, abduction, wise government, sedition, and the valiant defense of a pig shed.</p></p><p>Abraham Stoll is Assistant Professor of English, University of San Diego.<p>Teachers of Spenser will also welcome two more installments of the Hackett editions of separate books of <i>The Faerie Queene</i> under the general editorship of Abraham Stoll, this time on books 2 and on books 3 and 4.

In addition, Gray offers a list of some later writers influenced by Spenser's writing, situating Spenser in the broader literary canon and defining some preliminary connections for students for many literary fields.

There is no question that music makes a significant contribution to the quality of human life and that music can play a valuable role in the learning of virtually all subjects taught in the elementary schools. Music for Elementary School Teachers is a concise, easy-to-understand book that covers the essentials of what future elementary classroom teachers need to know in the area of music. It emphasizes the cooperative-supportive role of elementary classroom teachers with music teachers and demonstrates how music can be used with other curricular and classroom activities to enhance and enrich the learning of all subjects. Furthermore, the text&#x2019;s comprehensive coverage is more than adequate for those teachers who find themselves responsible for all the music instruction their students will receive. Outstanding features: 1) Hoffer&#x2019;s presentation is easy to comprehend and is unintimidating for future classroom teachers who have had little music instruction themselves; 2) it covers methods and skills that elementary education majors can normally master in a one-semester course; 3) many helpful suggestions on how to involve music with the teaching and learning of all subjects and with classroom management are valuable for both prospective and practicing teachers; 4) the inclusion of "Projects" and "Review Questions" ensures the maximum comprehension of the material presented in the text; 5) "Skill Development" sections facilitate the learning of rudimentary skills in making music and understanding music notation and provide the opportunities to practice and perfect these skills; and 6) although it does include many songs, it calls upon the student to make use of the existing elementary school music books and their CDS.<p> Also available from Waveland Press by Charles Hoffer, <i>Introduction to Music Education,</i> Fourth Edition (ISBN 9781478634072).</p></p><p>Also by Charles Hoffer and available from Waveland Press: Introduction to Music Education, Third Edition (ISBN 9781577665496)."I love this book.

Wilson trims his monumental work to its essential argument and most compelling examples. He retains the full basic structure of the original book, while eliminating the technical discussions and data summaries. Because of the unusual amount of interest and commentary it has generated, the final chapter on human social behavior remains virtually intact. The book has been completely reset to accommodate a convenient 8 1/2 x 11 format, and Sarah Landry's superb drawings of animal societies still accompany the text. New students and general readers can discover for themselves what sociobiology is all about and why there is so much furor surrounding it.</p></p><p>E.O. Wilson defines sociobiology as "the systematic study of the biological basis of all social behavior," the central theoretical problem of which is the question of how behaviors that seemingly contradict the principles of natural selection, such as altruism, can develop. <i>Sociobiology: A New Synthesis</i>, Wilson's first attempt to outline the new field of study, was first published in 1975 and called for a fairly revolutionary update to the so-called Modern Synthesis of evolutionary biology. Sociobiology as a new field of study demanded the active inclusion of sociology, the social sciences, and the humanities in evolutionary theory. Often criticized for its apparent message of "biological destiny," <i>Sociobiology</i> set the stage for such controversial works as Richard Dawkins's <i>The Selfish Gene</i> and Wilson's own <i>Consilience</i>. <p> <i>Sociobiology</i> defines such concepts as society, individual, population, communication, and regulation. It attempts to explain, biologically, why groups of animals behave the way they do when finding food or shelter, confronting enemies, or getting along with one another. Wilson seeks to explain how group selection, altruism, hierarchies, and sexual selection work in populations of animals, and to identify evolutionary trends and sociobiological characteristics of all animal groups, up to and including man. The insect sections of the books are particularly interesting, given Wilson's status as the world's most famous entomologist. </p><p> </p><blockquote>It is fair to say that as an ecological strategy eusociality has been overwhelmingly successful. It is useful to think of an insect colony as a diffuse organism, weighing anywhere from less than a gram to as much as a kilogram and possessing from about a hundred to a million or more tiny mouths.</blockquote><p> It's when Wilson starts talking about human beings that the furor starts. Feminists have been among the strongest critics of the work, arguing that humans are not slaves to a biological destiny, forever locked in "primitive" behavior patterns without the ability to reason past our biochemical nature. Like <i>The Origin of Species</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i> has forced many biologists and social scientists to reassess their most cherished notions of how animals work. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>Harvard University Press is proud to announce the re-release of the complete original version of Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, now available in paperback for the first time. When this classic work was first published in 1975, it created a new discipline and started a tumultuous round in the age-old nature versus nurture debate. Although voted by officers and fellows of the international Animal Behavior Society the most important book on animal behavior of all time, Sociobiology is probably more widely known as the object of bitter attacks by social scientists and other scholars who opposed its claim that human social behavior, indeed human nature, has a biological foundation. The controversy surrounding the publication of the book reverberates to the present day.</p><h2>Sherlock Holmes: The Thinking Engine</h2><p>Man vs Machine<br><br>it is 1895, and Sherlock Holmes is settling back into life as a consulting detective at 221B Baker Street, when he and Watson learn of strange goings-on amidst the dreaming spires of Oxford.<br><br>A Professor Quantock has built a wondrous computational device, which he claims is capable of analytical thought to rival the cleverest men alive.

Charlotte Maria Shaw Mason (1842-1923) was a British educator who invested her life in improving the quality of children&#39;s education. She was founder of the Charlotte Mason College of Education in England and was 100 years ahead of her time in developing an education philosophy that stressed bringing broad and stimulating education to a child in a noncompetitive, biblically based way. Mason&#39;s timeless, practical insights and her stress on the responsibility of the home have made her a founding influence in the home schooling movement. Her work has been especially influential in the United States.</p><p>Charlotte Mason, a renowned British educator, lived during the turn of the 20th century. She turned the idea of education being something of utilitarian necessity into an approach based upon living ideas. She believed that education is &#34;an atmosphere, a discipline, a life&#34; and a &#34;science of relations.&#34; Her methods are embraced around the world today, especially among the homeschool community.</p><h2>The Rebirthing of God: Christianity&#39;s Struggle for New Beginnings</h2><p><p><strong>Dare to imagine a new birth from deep within Christianity, a fresh stirring of the Spirit.</strong></p><blockquote><p>"The walls of Western Christianity are collapsing. In many parts of the West that collapse can only be described as seismic.... There are three main responses or reactions to this collapse. The first is to deny that it is happening. The second is to frantically try to shore up the foundations of the old thing. The third, which I invite us into, is to ask what is trying to be born that requires a radical reorientation of our vision.

Written by a respected writer, educator, and elder of the Jemez Pueblo, this rare, insider's view of the history of the 19 Indian Pueblos of New Mexico illuminates Pueblo historical traditions dating from millennia before the arrival of Columbus and chronicles the events and changes of the European era from the perspective of those who experienced them.<br>Drawing on both traditional oral history and written records, Sando describes the origin and development of Pueblo civilization, the Spanish conquest and occupation, the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, and the response of the pueblos to Mexican independence and conquest by the United States. Sando offers several portraits of notable Pueblo leaders whose contributions have helped shape the history of their people. He looks at internal developments in Pueblo government and presents a detailed account of the unremitting struggle to retain sovereignty, land, and water rights in the face of powerful outside pressures.<br><br>This new edition is fully indexed and updated.</p><p>Pueblo Nations: Eight Centuries of Pueblo Indian History is a rare insider&#39;s view into an ancient, fascinating, and vibrant people, written by a man uniquely qualified to tell this story.

This is an excellent book. --New York Times<br><br>Written by a Native American author from the Jemez Pueblo near Santa Fe, this updates his Pueblo Indians (Indian Historical Pr., 1976), and complements his Nee Hemish: A History of Jemez Pueblo (Univ. of New Mexico Pr., 1982). Discussed are origins and development of Pueblo civilization, Spanish conquest, the Pueblo Revolt of the 1680s, land, water, survival, and U.S. government influence. Text, maps, and bibliography are close to Pueblo Indians; new additions include recent events, discussion of the Columbian Quincentenary and the Pueblo Indians and additional photographs. Students of modern Pueblo history may wish to read Pueblo Nations in tandem with R.C. Gordon-McCutchan's The Taos Indians and the Battle for Blue Lake (Red Crane Bks., 1991). Author-educator Sando's work may help Pueblos understand their history from a Native American perspective and will illuminate Pueblo struggles and heritage for other readers.

Now this breathtaking book documents the fulfillment of this vision, from the hills of Shiloh where shepherds once roamed, to the booming city of Tel Aviv, founded on sand dunes, to the stellar beaches of Caesarea, transformed from a small village into one of Israel's most stunning coastal cities and finally Jerusalem, the Eternal City of Peace, where in ancient times the power of worship resounded from the Temple. Here, rarely seen photographs taken between the 1880s and the 1940s juxtaposed with contemporary images of the same locations illustrate the region's biblical history as a place of monumental battle, celebration, worship, and awesome resilience.<br><br>Whether by helicopter or on foot, on their own or with the aid of locals, author Doug Hershey and photographer Elise Monique Theriault negotiate the terrain to access the vantage points required to match the original photos, from the rooftop of Israel's National Museum of Science, Technology and Space in Haifa, to Jaffa Port's breakwater, and much more. Their quest creates a collection that will inspire and captivate as it illuminates Israel's foretold awakening in a new and unforgettable way.<br>To help facilitate this dramatic view of history, Israel Rising will start at the beginning. It will look at what exactly Ezekiel prophesied. It will explore the historical accounts from Jewish, Christian, and Muslim eyewitnesses of what the land and region has experience and endured. And photos from the 1880s-1940s will be compared to new photos of the same locations. With more than 175 photos, Israel Rising will depict the transformation of Israel as it celebrates its 70th anniversary.</p><p>Doug Hershey is an author, conference speaker and founder of Ezra Adventures, an Israel focused travel and education company.

But after the idealistic Felix Holt also returns to the town, the difference between Harold&#39;s opportunistic values and Holt&#39;s profound beliefs becomes apparent. Forthright, brusque and driven by a firm desire to educate the working-class, Felix is at first viewed with suspicion by many, including the elegant but vain Esther Lyon, the daughter of the local clergyman. As she discovers, however, his blunt words conceal both passion and deep integrity. Soon the romantic and over-refined Esther finds herself overwhelmed by a heart-wrenching decision: whether to choose the wealthy Transome as a husband, or the impoverished but honest Felix Holt.</p><p>The Broadview Literary Texts series is an effort to represent the ever-changing canon of literature in English by bringing together texts long regarded as classics with valuable, though lesser-known literature.Just as the 1832 Reform Act is about to change the bucolic and conservatively ordered way of life forever in Treby Magna, two native sons return home. Harold Transome, heir to Transome Court, comes to claim his inheritance and campaign for a Radical seat in Parliament. Felix Holt, and artisan and very different radical, returns to stir the new electorate to a sense of worth and destiny.</p><h2>Disruptive Christian Ethics: When Racism and Women&#39;s Lives Matter</h2><p><p>This book brings to the fore the difficult realities of racism and the sexual violation of women.

At one time, these two independently wealthy Jewish women from Baltimore received offers from virtually every prominent art museum in the world, all anxious to house their hitherto private assemblage of modern art. In 1949, they awarded all their holdings to the Baltimore Museum of Art. In 2002, that collection was valued at nearly $1 billion, making them two of the most philanthropic art collectors of our age.Yet, for complex reasons, the story of the Cone sisters has never been fully or accurately told.Mary Gabriel, an art-minded journalist and women&#x2019;s historian, has, at long last, brought the little-known sisters to life, and shone the spotlight on their remarkable achievements."</p><p><p>Mary Gabriel, an art-minded journalist and women's historian, has, at long last, brought the little-known sisters to life, and shone the spotlight on their remarkable achievements.</p>The story of how two spinster sisters from Baltimore acquired a remarkable collection of the sensual, avant-garde paintings of early 20th-century artists: Matisse, Picasso, Gauguin, and others. Their biographer, a former Reuters reporter and editor, is also the author of a life of Victoria Woodhull (1998). The Baltimore Museum of Art's Cone collection and the wing that houses it is the legacy of Dr. Claribel and Etta Cone, among the heirs to a family fortune based in part on textile manufacture. Etta was dedicated to caring for her extended family; Claribel was the more adventurous, graduating first in her class from medical school in 1890. The sisters came to know Leo and Gertrude Stein during the Steins' early sojourn in Baltimore; intrigued by the Steins' reports of their hedonistic summers in Europe, Etta set sail for Italy in the spring of 1901 and alternated between Baltimore and Europe for the rest of her life; her friendships with and support of artists, particularly Matisse, were to continue as long. Claribel too turned from science to art, after sticking it out as a medical researcher in Germany through the beginning of Hitler's rise. The sisters' separate apartments in Baltimore were filled not only with paintings, prints, drawings, and sculptures but also with fabrics, jewels, and artifacts collected from around the world. After Claribel's death in 1929, Etta set out to fill the gaps in the collection and published an illustrated book of works that she owned, by then including Czanne, Renoir, and Degas, among many others. Etta died in 1949, following the purchase of yet another Picasso. A pleasant addition to the Baltimore Museum's gift-shop offerings, perhaps, but this slight romance of two sisters in Paris when artistic ferment was at its height offers little real insight into collecting or the collectors.

But Petrona's unusual behavior belies more than shyness. She is a young woman crumbling under the burden of providing for her family as the rip tide of first love pulls her in the opposite direction. As both girls' families scramble to maintain stability amidst the rapidly escalating conflict, Petrona and Chula find themselves entangled in a web of secrecy that will force them both to choose between sacrifice and betrayal. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspired by the author's own life, and told through the alternating perspectives of the willful Chula and the achingly hopeful Petrona, <i>Fruit of the Drunken Tree</i> contrasts two very different, but inextricably linked coming-of-age stories. In lush prose, Rojas Contreras has written a powerful testament to the impossible choices women are often forced to make in the face of violence and the unexpected connections that can blossom out of desperation.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of August 2018:</strong> While this autobiographically-inspired novel vividly summons the turmoil of 1990s Colombia, it&#x2019;s more a story of private intimacies than national history. Nine-year-old Chula Santiago becomes obsessed with her family&#x2019;s new housekeeper, Petrona, a 13-year-old of few words who lives far from Chula&#x2019;s comfortable neighborhood. Chapters told from Petrona&#x2019;s perspective offer a glimpse into a mirror-world of Bogot� where breakfast varies based on what soda she pours over stale bread for her many siblings. What starts as a lyrical domestic portrait turns increasingly tense as we&#x2019;re forced to chart the collision course between two sweetnesses in Petrona&#x2019;s life: her first boyfriend, and her growing closeness to the Santiago family. The civil war underway shimmers menacingly within the perspectives of both narrators: there&#x2019;s an assassination, a car bombing at a mall, and of course the infamous Escobar manhunt that breathes a narco-haze over the country. There&#x2019;s magical realism here, but it&#x2019;s not Garc�a M�rquez&#x2019;s; it vines up from the distortions introduced by childhood: the naivet�, overheard adult conversations, the wildness of unsupervised outdoor play during the apagones (electricity rationing), and the lead blanket of first promises. <em>--Katy Ball</em>Ingrid Rojas Contreras was born and raised in Bogot�, Colombia.

They give specific and appropriately timed messages which can assist the dreamer with problem solving, artistic inspiration, psychological development, and spiritual deepening. They are also important for healing. To the therapist every dream reveals information about past and present psychic structures or complexes of the dreamer, and tells about psychological dynamics and developmental capacities. It reveals the dreamer&#39;s relations to the spiritual and personal dimensions of life, to the Self, and to archetypal images and drives. In Dreams, A Portal to the Source Edward C. Whitmont and Sylvia Brinton Perera, both leading Jungian analysts, provide an extensive guide to dream interpretation. Practical in approach, it is designed primarily for psychoanalysts and therapists who wish to integrate dream interpretation into their clinical practice. Among the topics covered are the language of dream images; the interplay between archetypal and personal levels; the dream&#39;s dramatic structure; and body imagery in dreams</p><p>Edward C. Whitmont and Sylvia Brinton Perera both teach at the C. G.

This long-awaited second edition, expanded and completely updated, will be equally revered. <br><br>Like its predecessor, this edition of <i>Indexing Books</i> offers comprehensive, reliable treatment of indexing principles and practices relevant to authors and indexers alike. In addition to practical advice, the book presents a big-picture perspective on the nature and purpose of indexes and their role in published works. New to this edition are discussions of "information overload" and the role of the index, open-system versus closed-system indexing, electronic submission and display of indexes, and trends in software development, among other topics.<br>Mulvany is equally comfortable focusing on the nuts and bolts of indexing&#x2014;how to determine what is indexable, how to decide the depth of an index, and how to work with publisher instructions&#x2014;and broadly surveying important sources of indexing guidelines such as <i>The </i><i>Chicago Manual of Style</i>, Sun Microsystems, Oxford University Press, <i>NISO TR03</i>, and <i>ISO 999</i>. Authors will appreciate Mulvany's in-depth consideration of the costs and benefits of preparing one's own index versus hiring a professional, while professional indexers will value Mulvany's insights into computer-aided indexing. Helpful appendixes include resources for indexers, a worksheet for general index specifications, and a bibliography of sources to consult for further information on a range of topics. <br><br><i>Indexing Books </i>is both a practical guide and a manifesto about the vital role of the human-crafted index in the Information Age.

If you are Nancy Mulvany, professional indexer and author of the industry standard <i>Indexing Books</i>, you write a second edition that reflects the concerns of indexers in the 21st century." (Dick Evans <i>Technical Communication</i>)<br><br>"I am a huge fan of this book. It is engagingly written in jargon-free English with a well-designed format. I highly recommend it for all faculty of information studies libraries and those libraries that may have among their users would-be indexers or authors that are interested in knowing about the methods of indexing their books. . . . This second edition should replace the first edition on library shelves."&nbsp; (Jean Weihs <i>Technicalities</i>)</p><h2>Simone Weil&#39;s The Iliad or the Poem of Force: A Critical Edition</h2><p>Simone Weil, a brilliant young teacher, philosopher, and social activist, wrote the essay, <i>The &#x2018;Iliad&#x2019; or the Poem of Force</i> at France at the beginning of World War II. Her profound meditation on the nature of violence provides a remarkably vivid and accessible testament of the Greek epic&#x2019;s continuing relevance to our lives. This celebrated work appears here for the first time in a bilingual version, based on the text of the authoritative edition of the author&#x2019;s complete writings. An introduction discusses the significance of the essay both in the evolution of Weil&#x2019;s thought and as a distinctively iconoclastic contribution to Homeric studies. The commentary draws on recent interpretations of the <i>Iliad</i> and examines the parallels between Weil&#x2019;s vision of Homer&#x2019;s warriors and the experiences of modern soldiers.</p><p>The Editor and Translator: James P. Holoka is Professor of Classics and Ancient History at Eastern Michigan University. He received his Ph.D. in comparative literature from the University of Michigan.�The &#x2018;Iliad&#x2019; is arguably the most influential work in the whole of Western literature. No discussion of it is more precious than the passionate, profound, and penetrating essay of Simone Weil, who uses the Greek epic to illuminate the human condition and the tragic theme of destruction and war. Its appearance in this book is welcome and important.� (Jasper Griffin, Professor of Classical Literature, Balliol College, Oxford University; Author of &#x2018;Homer on Life and Death&#x2019;)<br> �This new edition of Weil&#x2019;s well-known essay on the &#x2018;Iliad&#x2019; is welcome on several counts. James P. Holoka&#x2019;s commentary and notes draw richly yet judiciously from scholarship on both Weil and her beloved Homer, and his translation fairly matches the limpid French of the original. In an age feverish with wars and their rumor, it is hard to imagine that any reader will be unaffected by Weil&#x2019;s vigorously argued perceptions in what must be rated one of the most effective briefs ever written against the inhuman nature of violence. This book will benefit students and teachers in French, classical studies, philosophy, psychology, and anthropology.� (Thomas R.

They show how the young Shakespeare, working closely from his chronicle sources, nevertheless freely shaped his complex material to make it both theatrically effective and poetically innovative. The resulting work creates, in Queen Margaret, one of Shakespeare&#39;s strongest female roles and is the source of the popular view of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick as `kingmaker&#39;.

The anthology, which features a Foreword by National Book Award winner Colum McCann, includes the best voices of the wars&#x2019; generation: award-winning author Phil Klay&#x2019;s &#x201c;Redeployment;&#x201d; Brian Turner, whose poem &#x201c;Hurt Locker&#x201d; was the movie's inspiration; Colby Buzzell, whose book <i>My War</i> resonates with countless veterans; Siobhan Fallon, whose book <i>You Know When the Men Are Gone</i> echoes the joy and pain of the spouses left behind; Matt Gallagher, whose book <i>Kaboom</i> captures the hilarity and horror of the modern military experience; and ten others.<br></p><p>Contributors include:<br><br><b>Matt Gallagher</b> co-editor of <i>Fire and Forget</i> and author of <i>Kaboom</i><br><b>Roy Scranton</b> co-editor of <i>Fire and Forget</i><br><b>Colum McCann</b> National Book Award winner and best-selling author of <i>Let the Great World Spin</i><br><b>Siobhan Fallon</b> author of <i>You Know When the Men Are Gone</i><br><b>Colby Buzzell</b> author of <i>My War</i><br><b>Brian Turner</b> author of <i>Here, Bullet</i> ( Hurt Locker&#x201d;)<br>and nine others."Searing stories from the war zones of Afghanistan, Iraq, and the USA by warrior writers. <i>Fire and Forget</i>&nbsp;is about not forgetting.

Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. Through their parallel experience of love - and its threatened loss - the sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love.</p><p>Though not the first novel she wrote, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was the first Jane Austen published. Though she initially called it <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>, Austen jettisoned both the title and the epistolary mode in which it was originally written, but kept the essential theme: the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. The story revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Whereas the former is a sensible, rational creature, her younger sister is wildly romantic--a characteristic that offers Austen plenty of scope for both satire and compassion. Commenting on Edward Ferrars, a potential suitor for Elinor's hand, Marianne admits that while she "loves him tenderly," she finds him disappointing as a possible lover for her sister: <blockquote> Oh! Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference! </blockquote> Soon however, Marianne meets a man who measures up to her ideal: Mr. Willoughby, a new neighbor. So swept away by passion is Marianne that her behavior begins to border on the scandalous. Then Willoughby abandons her; meanwhile, Elinor's growing affection for Edward suffers a check when he admits he is secretly engaged to a childhood sweetheart. How each of the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Jane Austen&#39;s first published novel introduced many of the themes which would dominate Austen&#39;s future work. Austen writes about everyday events of her own time with a subtlety and sensitivity unprecedented in the English novel. This edition, first published in 2006, follows the second edition of 1813, which corrects errors of the first edition.</p><h2>And I&#39;d Do it Again: The Extraordinary Adventures of an Edwardian Heiress</h2><p>Aim�e Crocker was an heiress to gold and railroad fortunes and a daughter of Judge Edwin B. Crocker (1818-1875), legal counsel for the Central Pacific Railroad, Justice of the California Supreme Court in 1865 and founder of the Crocker Art Museum. Her father was a brother of Charles Crocker, one of the &#34;big four&#34; California railroad barons. Aim�e had a tale or two to tell. Aside from lavish parties, husbands, and lovers, she traveled widely throughout Asia. She tells of escaping headhunters in Borneo, poisoning in Hong Kong, and avoiding murder by servants in Shanghai. While away, she was christened Princess Palaikalani Bliss of Heaven by King David Kalakaua, the last king of Hawaii, and then Princess Galitzine when she wed her fifth and final husband, Prince Mstislav Galitzine. This is her autobiography, first published in 1936.</p><p><b>Aim�e Crocker</b> was an American heiress, Bohemian, world traveler, and author best known for her travel adventures, her extravagant parties, and her collections of husbands and lovers, adopted children, Buddhas, tattoos, and snakes. <b>Helen Lederer</b> is a comedian best known for being in&nbsp;<i>Absolutely Fabulous</i>, and the author of<i> Losing It</i>.&nbsp;"Crocker has a certain forthright energy and arrogance: reading her chronicle of ripping yarns is like being repeatedly offered strong cocktails by someone determined you shan't go home. And she has mixed them herself . . . I was so exhausted by the end that I collapsed into the new Joanna Trollope, reflecting that what we women consider an adventure these days is pretty damn tame." &#x2014;<i>TLS&nbsp;</i></p><h2>Moment of Astrology: Origins in Divination</h2><p>This is the revised edition of one of the most important astrological books of our time. It not only reshapes the view of astrology that astrologers might have; it challenges the entire notion of what constitutes knowing and knowledge in our civilisation. It shows that astrology is not only important in and of itself, but also for what it reveals about the nature of truth and our experience in general. (Robert Hand).</p><p>Geoffrey Cornelius is a consultant astrologer with a background in philosophy and divination. He has been active in the educational aspect of astrology since the 1970s, and has been President of both the Astrological Lodge of the Theosophical Society and the Astrological Lodge of London. He also co-founded and is a guiding force in The Company of Astrologers, based in Brighton.</p><h2>A People&#39;s History of Science: Miners, Midwives, and Low Mechanicks</h2><p>We all know the history of science that we learned from grade school textbooks: How Galileo used his telescope to show that the earth was not the center of the universe; how Newton divined gravity from the falling apple; how Einstein unlocked the mysteries of time and space with a simple equation. This history is made up of long periods of ignorance and confusion, punctuated once an age by a brilliant thinker who puts it all together. These few tower over the ordinary mass of people, and in the traditional account, it is to them that we owe science in its entirety. This belief is wrong. A People&#39;s History of Science shows how ordinary people participate in creating science and have done so throughout history. It documents how the development of science has affected ordinary people, and how ordinary people perceived that development. It would be wrong to claim that the formulation of quantum theory or the structure of DNA can be credited directly to artisans or peasants, but if modern science is likened to a skyscraper, then those twentieth-century triumphs are the sophisticated filigrees at its pinnacle that are supported by the massive foundation created by the rest of us.</p><p><b>Clifford D. Conner</b> teaches at John Jay School of Criminal Law in New York. His previous writings on the era of the French Revolution include a biography of Jean-Paul Marat.In this persuasive history, Conner aggressively pursues evidence of how, since the earliest civilizations, elite scientists have suppressed and excluded lower class innovators while learning from and using their discoveries, often without giving them credit. As Conner notes, many of the "Great Man" myths about people like Galileo and Columbus, once believed to have made their contributions to science out of their own genius, have been debunked, but even those persist in the popular imagination, and others have never been addressed. The pages are dense with information and quotes from both primary sources and modern revisionist historians, and Conner tries to cover too much in too little space, but he writes clearly and skillfully shows connections as he ranges across time periods and disciplines from medicine to art to astronomy. However, despite promising to highlight women's important role in the sciences, they are mostly absent, and the brief chapter on modern times mostly concerns itself with corruption in the pharmaceuticals and atomic weaponry industries. Nonetheless, this book is a valuable synthesis of previously spotty attempts to show science's reliance on the anonymous multitudes for many important advances.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This Norton Critical Edition is based on the 1912 text. It is accompanied by a detailed introduction, explanatory footnotes, and a note on the text. The appendices that follow the novel include materials available in no other edition: manuscript drafts of the final chapters, including the original lynching scene (chapter 10, ca. 1910) and the original ending (chapter 11, ca. 1908).<br><br> An unusually rich selection of &#x201c;Backgrounds and Sources&#x201d; focuses on Johnson&#x2019;s life; the autobiographical inspirations for <em>The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man</em>; the cultural history of the era in which Johnson lived and wrote; the noteworthy reception history for the 1912, 1927, and 1948 editions; and related writings by Johnson. In addition to Johnson, contributors include Eugene Levy, W. E. B. Du Bois, Carl Van Vechten, Blanche W. Knopf, &nbsp;and Victor Weybright among others.<br><br> The four critical essays and interpretations in this volume speak to <em>The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man</em>&#x2019;s major themes, among them irony, authorship, passing, and parody. Assessments are provided by Robert B. Stepto, M. Giulia Fabi, Siobhan B. Somerville, and Christina L. Ruotolo.<br><br> A chronology of Johnson&#x2019;s life and work and a selected bibliography are also included, as well as six images.<br> 12</p><p>With the possible exceptions of Dr. Alain Locke and W.E.B. Du Bois, no African American excelled on as many different levels as James Weldon Johnson. <i>Along This Way</i>--the first autobiography by a person of color to be reviewed in <i>The New York Times</i>--not only chronicles his life as an educator, lawyer, diplomat, newspaper editor, lyricist, poet, essayist, and political activist but also outlines the trials and triumphs of African Americans from post-Reconstruction to the rise and fall of the Harlem Renaissance. Born in Florida in 1871 to middle-class West Indian parents, Johnson recognized the challenges and absurdities of segregated America early on. But it was his experience as a tutor to rural blacks while a student at Atlanta University that was to alter the course of his life: "It was this period that marked the beginning of psychological change from boyhood to manhood," he writes. "It was this period that marked also the beginning of my knowledge of my own people as a race." <p> With a rare blend of pride and humility, Johnson recounts how he, among other accomplishments, became Florida's first black lawyer in 1898, a diplomat in Venezuela and Nicaragua, and lyricist for his brother Rosamond Johnson's famous song, "Lift Every Voice and Sing." Johnson's commentary on his epochal novel, <i>The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man</i>, as well as writings on his works of poetry--<i>The Creation</i>, <i>God's Trombones</i>, and <i>Fifty Years and Other Poems</i>--is priceless. Equally important are the logical and even-tempered opinions on race that he wrote for <i>The New York Age</i>, which offered comprehensive critiques of Du Bois, Booker T. Washington, and Marcus Garvey, along with his analysis of the racial climate while serving as head of the NAACP. This remarkable man left a mark on the 20th century that goes beyond the boundary of race. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i></p>One of the most prominent African-Americans of his time, James Weldon Johnson (1871&#x2013;1938) was a successful lawyer, educator, social reformer, songwriter, and critic. But it was as a poet and novelist that he achieved lasting fame. <br>Among his most famous works, <i>The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man </i>in many ways parallels Johnson's own remarkable life. First published in 1912, the novel relates, through an anonymous narrator, events in the life of an American of mixed ethnicity whose exceptional abilities and ambiguous appearance allow him unusual social mobility&#x2014;from the rural South to the urban North and eventually to Europe. <br>A radical departure from earlier books by black authors, this pioneering work not only probes the psychological aspects of "passing for white" but also examines the American caste and class system. The human drama is powerful and revealing&#x2014;from the narrator's persistent battles with personal demons to his firsthand observations of a Southern lynching and the mingling of races in New York's bohemian atmosphere at the turn of the century. <br>Revolutionary for its time, the <i> Autobiography</i> remains both an unrivaled example of black expression and a major contribution to American literature.</p><h2>Psychology: Modules for Active Learning</h2><p>PSYCHOLOGY: MODULES FOR ACTIVE LEARNING combines the highly effective SQ4R (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Reflect, Review) active learning system, an engaging style, appealing visuals, and detailed coverage of core topics and cutting-edge research in one remarkable text.

In addition, their images of a mythical world profoundly influenced latter-day storytellers as Richard Wagner and J. R. R. Tolkien.<br>Known as the "Lays of the Gods," these mythological poems include the <i>Voluspo</i>, one of the broadest conceptions of the world's creation and ultimate destruction ever crystallized in literary form; the <i>Hovamol</i>, a compilation of sagacious counsels reminiscent of the biblical book of Proverbs; the <i>Lokasenna</i>, a comedy bursting with vivid characterizations; and the <i>Thrymskvitha</i>, a ballad of enduring loveliness.<br><i>The Poetic Edda</i> is not only of the highest interest to students of antiquity; in the exceptionally detailed and complete translations included here, it offers lovers of poetry and myth some of the most remarkable surviving specimens from a distant age of poet-singers and oral traditions.</p><p></p><h2>The Number Sense: How the Mind Creates Mathematics</h2><p>Our understanding of how the human brain performs mathematical calculations is far from complete. But in recent years there have been many exciting scientific discoveries, some aided by new imaging techniques--which allow us for the first time to watch the living mind at work--and others by ingenious experiments conducted by researchers all over the world. There are still perplexing mysteries--how, for instance, do idiot savants perform almost miraculous mathematical feats?--but the picture is growing steadily clearer. In <em>The Number Sense</em>, Stanislas Dehaene offers general readers a first look at these recent stunning discoveries, in an enlightening exploration of the mathematical mind. <br> Dehaene, a mathematician turned cognitive neuropsychologist, begins with the eye-opening discovery that animals--including rats, pigeons, raccoons, and chimpanzees--can perform simple mathematical calculations, and he describes ingenious experiments that show that human infants also have a rudimentary number sense (American scientist Karen Wynn, for instance, using just a few Mickey Mouse toys and a small puppet theater, proved that five-month-old infants already have the ability to add and subtract). Further, Dehaene suggests that this rudimentary number sense is as basic to the way the brain understands the world as our perception of color or of objects in space, and, like these other abilities, our number sense is wired into the brain. But how then did the brain leap from this basic number ability to trigonometry, calculus, and beyond? Dehaene shows that it was the invention of symbolic systems of numerals that started us on the climb to higher mathematics, and in a marvelous chapter he traces the history of numbers, from early times when people indicated a number by pointing to a part of their body (even today, in many societies in New Guinea, the word for six is "wrist"), to early abstract numbers such as Roman numerals (chosen for the ease with which they could be carved into wooden sticks), to modern numbers. On our way, we also discover many fascinating facts: for example, because Chinese names for numbers are so short, Chinese people can remember up to nine or ten digits at a time--English-speaking people can only remember seven. Dehaene also explores the unique abilities of idiot savants and mathematical geniuses, asking what might explain their special mathematical talent. And we meet people whose minute brain lesions render their mathematical ability useless--one man, in fact, who is certain that two and two is three. Using modern imaging techniques (PET scans and MRI), Dehaene reveals exactly where in the brain numerical calculation takes place. But perhaps most important, <em>The Number Sense</em> reaches many provocative conclusions that will intrigue anyone interested in mathematics or the mind. Dehaene argues, for instance, that many of the difficulties that children face when learning math, and which may turn into a full-blown adult "innumeracy," stem from the architecture of our primate brain, which has not evolved for the purpose of doing mathematics. He also shows why the human brain does not work like a computer, and that the physical world is not based on mathematics--rather, mathematics evolved to explain the physical world the way that the eye evolved to provide sight. <br> A truly fascinating look at the crossroads where numbers and neurons intersect, <em>The Number Sense</em> offers an intriguing tour of how the structure of the brain shapes our mathematical abilities, and how our mathematics opens up a window on the human mind.</p><p>This may surprise those who have trouble carrying the remainder in division or figuring out a 15 percent tip on a $20 lunch bill, but according to mathematician and psychologist Stanislas Dehaene, mathematics is an inborn skill. In <i>The Number Sense</i>, Dehaene makes a compelling case for the human mind's innate grasp of mathematics. Take, for example, the fact that place value systems (such as the Arabic numeral system we use) arose independently in four separate civilizations--evidence of a universal sense of number. Dehaene's book is filled with examples to support his thesis, from young babies' ability to "count" (i.e., to react when single objects are replaced by two or more) to examples of how brain damage affects various individuals' number sense. Even more fascinating is his discussion of the relationship between language and numbers. Though Dehaene's book is about mathematics, even those readers with the worst math anxiety will find <i>The Number Sense</i> an intriguing exploration of the world of numbers--and the human mind.<br><em>About the Author:</em><br><strong>Stanislas Dehaene</strong> is Research Affiliate at the Institute de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, in Paris, France.<br></p><h2>Great Expectations (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>&#34;Great Expectations&#34; is at once a superbly constructed novel of spellbinding mastery and a profound examination of moral values. Here, some of Dickens&#39;s most memorable characters come to play their part in a story whose title itself reflects the deep irony that shaped Dickens&#39;s searching reappraisal of the Victorian middle class.</p><p>Dickens considered <i>Great Expectations</i> one of his "little pieces," and indeed, it <i>is</i> slim compared to such weighty novels as <i>David Copperfield</i> or <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>. But what this cautionary tale of a young man raised high above his station by a mysterious benefactor lacks in length, it more than makes up for in its remarkable characters and compelling story. The novel begins with young orphaned Philip Pirrip--Pip--running afoul of an escaped convict in a cemetery. This terrifying personage bullies Pip into stealing food and a file for him, threatening that if he tells a soul "your heart and your liver shall be tore out, roasted and ate." The boy does as he's asked, but the convict is captured anyway, and transported to the penal colonies in Australia. Having started his novel in a cemetery, Dickens then ups the stakes and introduces his hero into the decaying household of Miss Havisham, a wealthy, half-mad woman who was jilted on her wedding day many years before and has never recovered. Pip is brought there to play with Miss Havisham's ward, Estella, a little girl who delights in tormenting Pip about his rough hands and future as a blacksmith's apprentice. <blockquote> I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began to consider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so strong, that it became infectious, and I caught it. </blockquote> It is an infection that Pip never quite recovers from; as he spends more time with Miss Havisham and the tantalizing Estella, he becomes more and more discontented with his guardian, the kindhearted blacksmith, Joe, and his childhood friend Biddy. When, after several years, Pip becomes the heir of an unknown benefactor, he leaps at the chance to leave his home and friends behind to go to London and become a gentleman. But having expectations, as Pip soon learns, is a two-edged sword, and nothing is as he thought it would be. Like that other "little piece," <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, <i>Great Expectations</i> is different from the usual Dickensian fare: the story is dark, almost surreal at times, and you'll find few of the author's patented comic characters and no comic set pieces. And yet this is arguably the most compelling of Dickens's novels for, unlike David Copperfield or Martin Chuzzlewit, the reader can never be sure that things <i>will</i> work out for Pip. Even Dickens apparently had his doubts--he wrote two endings for this novel. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>The first book edition of Great Expectations was published in three volumes in 1861. It is now reissued simultaneously with the serialised version of 1860-1 and a newly photographed colour reproduction of the original manuscript, enabling scholars and enthusiasts to study the book version alongside the work-in-progress.</p><h2>Health Program Planning: An Educational and Ecological Approach</h2><p>This classic text by the creators of the PRECEDE-PROCEED model provides a comprehensive overview of the principles and processes of health promotion planning.

His colleagues resist her argument that human reason is overrated and that the inability to reason does not diminish the value of life; his wife denounces his mother's vegetarianism as a form of moral superiority.</p><p>At the dinner that follows her first lecture, the guests confront Costello with a range of sympathetic and skeptical reactions to issues of animal rights, touching on broad philosophical, anthropological, and religious perspectives. Painfully for her son, Elizabeth Costello seems offensive and flaky, but--dare he admit it?--strangely on target.</p><p>Here the internationally renowned writer J. M. Coetzee uses fiction to present a powerfully moving discussion of animal rights in all their complexity. He draws us into Elizabeth Costello's own sense of mortality, her compassion for animals, and her alienation from humans, even from her own family. In his fable, presented as a Tanner Lecture sponsored by the University Center for Human Values at Princeton University, Coetzee immerses us in a drama reflecting the real-life situation at hand: a writer delivering a lecture on an emotionally charged issue at a prestigious university. Literature, philosophy, performance, and deep human conviction--Coetzee brings all these elements into play.</p><p>As in the story of Elizabeth Costello, the Tanner Lecture is followed by responses treating the reader to a variety of perspectives, delivered by leading thinkers in different fields. Coetzee's text is accompanied by an introduction by political philosopher Amy Gutmann and responsive essays by religion scholar Wendy Doniger, primatologist Barbara Smuts, literary theorist Marjorie Garber, and moral philosopher Peter Singer, author of <i>Animal Liberation.</i> Together the lecture-fable and the essays explore the palpable social consequences of uncompromising moral conflict and confrontation.</p></p><p><p>"Coetzee stirs our imaginations by confronting us with an articulate, intelligent, aging, and increasingly alienated novelist who cannot help but be exasperated with her fellow human beings, many of them academics, who are unnecessarily cruel to animals, and apparently (but not admittedly) committed to cruelty. The story urges us to reconceive our devotion to reason as a universal value."--<b>From the introduction by Amy Gutmann</b></p><p>"Magnificent. . . . Coetzee's powerful and subtle text is irreducibly about real animal suffering, but it is also about much more."--<b>Phil Baker, <i>Sunday Times</i> (London)</b></p><b>J. M.

Bradley hopes to retire to the country, but predatory friends and relations dash his hopes of a peaceful retirement. He is tormented by his melancholic sister, who has decided to come live with him; his ex-wife, who has infuriating hopes of redeeming the past; her delinquent brother, who wants money and emotional confrontations; and Bradley&#39;s friend and rival, Arnold Baffin, a younger, deplorably more successful author of commercial fiction. The ever-mounting action includes marital cross-purposes, seduction, suicide, abduction, romantic idylls, murder, and due process of law. Bradley tries to escape from it all but fails, leading to a violent climax and a coda that casts shifting perspectives on all that has preceded.</p><p>A story about being in love <b> The Black Prince</b> is also a remarkable intellectual thriller with a superbly involuted plot, and a meditation on the nature of art and love and the deity who rules over both. Bradley Pearson, its narrator and hero, is an elderly writer with a 'block'. Encompassed by predatory friends and relations - his ex-wife, her delinquent brother and a younger, deplorably successful writer, Arnold Baffin, together with Baffin's restless wife and youthful daughter - Bradley attempts escape. His failure and its aftermath lead to a violent climax; and to a coda which casts a shifting perspective on all that has gone before.<p><b><b>Dame Iris Murdoch</b>&nbsp;</b>(1919-1999) was one of the most acclaimed British writers of the twentieth century.

Baum advises you on how to avoid platitudes and find your authentic voice, gives you tools and ideas that will spark your imagination, and shows you how to approach themes with originality and panache to make even the most tired topics&#x2014;the ones most students should stay away from&#x2014;fresh, such as: </p><ul><li>The trip (&#x201c;I had to adjust to a whole new way of life.&#x201d;)</li><li>My favorite things (puppy dogs, freedom, and chocolate chip cookies)</li><li>The pageant contestant (&#x201c;I think World Peace is the most important issue facing us today.&#x201d;)</li><li>The jock (&#x201c;Through wrestling I have learned to set goals and to work with people.&#x201d;)</li><li>The autobiography (&#x201c;Hello, my name is . . . &#x201d;)</li><li>Tales of my success (&#x201c;But, finally, when I crossed the finish line . . . &#x201d;)</li><li>Pet death (&#x201c;As I watched Buttons&#x2019;s life ebb away, I came to value . . . &#x201d;)</li></ul><p>Getting into the college of your dreams is tough.

There's no formula, no trick, no strategy, says Harry Bauld, a former Ivy League admissions officer. But with acceptance rates at all-time lows, just being yourself in an essay means understanding your readers and the unique form in which you are writing. In this fully revised and updated edition of the classic guide to writing the best essay of your life, Bauld reveals the big clich�s (The Trip, The Jock, Miss America, Pet Death) and helps you discover ways to come alive on the page as a real person instead of applicant number 13,791.</p><p>Harry Bauld has been a writer, teacher, and speaker for thirty years.

I take cards out of a file. Once I have taken them out, I put them back in again. That is it.'</i></b><br><br>Twenty-three-year-old Frits - office worker, daydreamer, teller of inappropriate jokes - finds life absurd and inexplicable. He lives with his parents, who drive him mad. He has terrible, disturbing dreams of death and destruction. Sometimes he talks to a toy rabbit.<br><br>This is the story of ten evenings in Frits's life at the end of December, as he drinks, smokes, sees friends, aimlessly wanders the gloomy city street and tries to make sense of the minutes, hours and days that stretch before him.<br><br>Darkly funny and mesmerising,&nbsp;<i>The Evenings</i>&nbsp;takes the tiny, quotidian triumphs and heartbreaks of our everyday lives and turns them into a work of brilliant wit and profound beauty.</p><p>Gerard Reve (1923-2006) is considered one of the greatest post-war Dutch authors, and was also the first openly gay writer in the country's history. A complicated and controversial character, Reve is also hugely popular and critically acclaimed- his 1947 debut <i>The Evenings</i> was chosen as one of the nation's 10 favourite books by the readers of a leading Dutch newspaper while the Society of Dutch Literature ranked it as the Netherlands' best novel of all time.I<br> It was still dark , in the early morning hours of the<br> twenty-second of December 1946, on the second floor of<br> the house at Schilderskade 66 in our town, when the hero of<br> this story, Frits van Egters, awoke. He looked at the luminous<br> dial of his watch, hanging on its nail. &#x201c;A quarter to six,&#x201d; he<br> mumbled, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s still night.&#x201d; He rubbed his face. &#x201c;What a horrible<br> dream,&#x201d; he thought. &#x201c;What was it again?&#x201d; Gradually it came<br> back to him. He had dreamt that the living room was full of<br> visitors. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be a glorious weekend,&#x201d; someone said.<br> At that same moment a man in a bowler hat walked in. No<br> one paid him any heed and no one greeted him, but Frits eyed<br> him closely. Suddenly the visitor fell to the floor with a thud.<br> &#x201c;Was that it?&#x201d; he thought. &#x201c;What happened after that?<br> Nothing, I believe.&#x201d; He fell asleep again. The dream went on<br> where it had stopped. His bowler pressed down over his face,<br> the man was now lying in a black coffin that had been placed on<br> a low table in one corner of the room. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t recognize that<br> table,&#x201d; Frits thought. &#x201c;Did we borrow it from someone?&#x201d; Then,<br> peering into the coffin, he said loudly: &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be stuck with this<br> till Monday, in any event.&#x201d; &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be so sure about that,&#x201d;<br> said a bald, red-faced man with spectacles. &#x201c;Would you care to<br> wager that I can arrange the funeral for this afternoon at two?&#x201d;<br>Frits awoke once more. It was twenty minutes past six. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve<br> had enough sleep,&#x201d; he said to himself, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s why I woke up so<br> early. I still have more than an hour to go.&#x201d;<br> He dozed off eventually, and entered the living room for<br> the third time. There was no one there. He walked over to the<br> coffin, looked into it and thought: &#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead, and starting to<br> rot.&#x201d; Suddenly the cadaver was covered in all kinds of carpenter&#x2019;s<br> tools, piled to the coffin&#x2019;s rim: hammers, drills, saws, spirit<br> levels, planes, pliers and little bags of nails. All that stuck out<br> was the dead man&#x2019;s right hand.<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no one here,&#x201d; he thought, &#x201c;not a soul in the house;<br> what am I going to do? Music, that always helps.&#x201d; He leaned<br> across the coffin to turn on the radio, but at that same moment<br> saw the hand, bluish now and with long white nails, begin to stir.<br> He recoiled in fear. &#x201c;I mustn&#x2019;t move,&#x201d; he thought, &#x201c;otherwise<br> it will happen.&#x201d; The hand sank back down.<br> Later he awoke, feeling anxious. &#x201c;Ten to seven,&#x201d; he mumbled,<br> peering at the watch. &#x201c;I always have such horrible dreams.&#x201d; He<br> rolled over and fell asleep again.<br> Parting a pair of thick green curtains, he entered the living<br> room. The visitors had returned. The man with the red face<br> came up to him, smiled and said: &#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t work out. It will<br> have to be Monday morning, at ten. We can put the box in the<br> study till then.&#x201d; &#x201c;Study?&#x201d; Frits thought. &#x201c;What study? Do we<br> have a study? He means the side room, of course.&#x201d; Six men<br> lifted the coffin to their shoulders. He himself walked out in<br> front, to open the door for them. &#x201c;The key&#x2019;s still in the lock,&#x201d;<br> he thought, &#x201c;good thing, too.&#x201d;<br>The coffin was extremely heavy; the bearers moved slowly,<br> with measured strides. Suddenly he saw that the bottom of the<br> box was beginning to sag and swell. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to burst,&#x201d; he<br> thought, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s hideous. The corpse is still intact on the outside,<br> but inside it&#x2019;s a thin, yellow mush. It will splatter all over the floor.&#x201d;<br> By the time they were halfway down the hall, the bottom<br> was sagging so badly that it had begun to crack. Slowly, out of<br> that crack, appeared the same hand from which he had recoiled.<br> Gradually the whole arm followed. The fingers groped about,<br> then crept towards the throat of one of the bearers. &#x201c;If I scream,<br> the whole thing will fall to the floor,&#x201d; Frits thought. He watched<br> as the bottom sagged further and further and the hand drew<br> closer and closer to the bearer&#x2019;s throat. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing I can<br> do,&#x201d; he thought. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do a thing.&#x201d;<br> He awakened for the fourth time, and sat up in bed. It was<br> seven thirty-five. The bedroom was cold. He sat there for five<br> minutes, then stood up and, turning on the light, saw the windowpanes<br> covered in flowers of frost. He shivered as he made<br> his way to the toilet.<br> &#x201c;I should start going out for a little walk in the evening, before<br> bed,&#x201d; he thought while washing himself at the kitchen sink. &#x201c;It<br> would make me sleep more soundly.&#x201d; The soap slipped through<br> his fingers, and he spent quite some time feeling around for it in<br> the shadowy space beneath the counter. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re off to a roaring<br> start,&#x201d; he mumbled.<br> &#x201c;But today&#x2019;s Sunday,&#x201d; he realized suddenly, &#x201c;what a piece<br> of luck.&#x201d; Then he added to himself: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m up far too early, how<br> stupid of me. But no, for once my day won&#x2019;t be ruined by lying<br>around till eleven.&#x201d; While drying his face he started to hum,<br> then went into his room, dressed, and combed his hair in the<br> little mirror that hung beside the door, above one corner of the<br> bed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s ridiculously early,&#x201d; he thought. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t go in yet. The<br> sliding doors are still open.&#x201d;<br> He sat down at his little desk, picked up a white marble rabbit<br> about the size of a matchbox and tapped it softly against the<br> arm of the chair. Then he put it on top of the pile of papers<br> from whence it came. Standing up with a shiver, he returned to<br> the kitchen, opened the bread bin and took out two soft white<br> rolls, the first of which he stuffed into his mouth in a few bites.<br> The second he held clenched in his teeth as he went into the<br> hallway for his coat.<br> &#x201c;A brisk, invigorating walk in the morning air,&#x201d; he murmured.<br> As he crossed the landing and passed the downstairs neighbours&#x2019;<br> door, a dog yapped. He pulled the street door closed behind him<br> quietly and followed the frozen canal to the river, which was<br> covered along both banks with a dark layer of ice. There was<br> not much wind. The sun had barely risen, but the street lights<br> were already out. The gutters of the houses were lined with rows<br> of gulls. After kneading the last of his roll into a little ball, he<br> tossed it onto the ice and scores of birds descended. The first<br> gull that picked at it missed. The piece of bread slid, fell into a<br> little hole in the ice and sank before another bird could peck at it.<br> Church bells rang once. &#x201c;An early start, this will be a day<br> well spent,&#x201d; he thought, turning right along the riverbank. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s<br> cold and early and no one&#x2019;s out yet, but I am.&#x201d;</p><h2>SCIENCE 2008 ASSESSMENT BOOK GRADE 4</h2><p>Scott Foresman Science (Diamond Edition) (�2008)&nbsp;components for Grade 4.</p><p></p><h2>A Different Kind of Teacher: Solving the Crisis of American Schooling</h2><p>A hard-hitting collection of essays and articles written by a New York City school teacher exposes a system designed to promote economic and business interests and advocates a greater emphasis on teaching critical thinking skills.</p><p></p><h2>When Food Is Comfort: Nurture Yourself Mindfully, Rewire Your Brain, and End Emotional Eating</h2><p><strong>Learn Inner Nurturing and End Emotional Eating<br> </strong><br> If you regularly eat when you&#x2019;re not truly hungry, choose unhealthy comfort foods, or eat beyond fullness, something is out of balance. Recent advances in brain science have uncovered the crucial role that our early social and emotional environment plays in the development of imbalanced eating patterns. When we do not receive consistent and sufficient emotional nurturance during our early years, we are at greater risk of seeking it from external sources, such as food. Despite logical arguments, we have difficulty modifying our behavior because we are under the influence of an emotionally dominant part of the brain.<br> <br> The good news is that the brain can be rewired for optimal emotional health. <em>When Food Is Comfort</em> presents a breakthrough mindfulness practice called Inner Nurturing, a comprehensive, step-by-step program developed by an author who was herself an emotional eater. You&#x2019;ll learn how to nurture yourself with the loving-kindness you crave and handle stressors more easily so that you can stop turning to food for comfort.

Others are more difficult. And then there are situations that seem completely hopeless. Conflict is escalating, people are getting aggressive, and no one is willing to back down. And to top it off, you have little power or other resources to work with. Harvard professor and negotiation adviser Deepak Malhotra shows how to defuse even the most potentially explosive situations and to find success when things seem impossible.<br><br> Malhotra identifies three broad approaches for breaking deadlocks and resolving conflicts, and draws out scores of actionable lessons using behind-the-scenes stories of fascinating real-life negotiations, including drafting of the US Constitution, resolving the Cuban Missile Crisis, ending bitter disputes in the NFL and NHL, and beating the odds in complex business situations. But he also shows how these same principles and tactics can be applied in everyday life, whether you are&nbsp;making corporate deals,&nbsp;negotiating job offers, resolving business disputes,&nbsp;tackling obstacles in personal relationships, or&nbsp;even negotiating with children.<br><br> As Malhotra reminds us, regardless of the context or which issues are on the table, negotiation is always, fundamentally, about human interaction. No matter how high the stakes or how protracted the dispute, the object of negotiation is to engage with other human beings in a way that leads to better understandings and agreements. The principles and strategies in this book will help you do this more effectively in every situation.</p><p>Bestselling author and Harvard Business School&nbsp;professor Deepak Malhotra shows how to tackle even&nbsp;the most difficult, deadlocked, seemingly unsolvable&nbsp;conflicts.Deepak Malhotra is the Eli Goldston Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School.

In revealing talks with her longtime boyfriend, Tom, Valerie gets even more personal about her inner worries: her maternal anxieties about her son, Wolfie (he's fallen in love and, as she writes, "getting your sex talk from Eddie Van Halen wasn't recommended in any of the parenting books I read"); the challenges of dealing with a blended family; her mother's own new diet adventure; and a craving for a deeper relationship with a Higher Power ("I have experienced days of inner peace and connectedness with a larger spirit -- twice," she writes. "Why not more often?"). And as if these everyday challenges weren't enough, Valerie is work-ing to maintain her own very public weight loss. She even gets to thinking she might kick it up a notch, shed more weight and get so buff she can wear a bikini -- in public.<p>In this new, inspiring memoir from the beloved actress and author of the bestseller <i>Losing It</i>, Valerie tells the story of what happens <i>after</i> you change your life. It's not all peaches and cream, or even non-fat yogurt.</p><p>In <i>Finding It</i>, Valerie comes face-to-face with hard questions of family, faith, and beachwear, and realizes that she's hungering for another transfor-mation -- to become better, not just thinner. Forget the scale; the real change is happening inside, and Valerie realizes that this is the part of dieting that no one ever talks about -- the reality of keeping the pounds off. Dieting fixes one problem, she discovers, but to maintain that weight loss, she has to work on everything else -- all the reasons she got fat in the first place.Warm and friendly, honest and self-aware -- like a talk with your BFF -- <i>Finding It</i> tells of the common worries and frustrations, the funny and fabulous moments in Valerie's publicly private life. Humorous and humble, it is also the emotional story of family and the deep bonds and patterns that persist through generations: for as Valerie transitions to her latest role of motherhood with an increasingly independent son, she connects with her own mother in a profound new way.</p><p>With the same winning wit and candor that touched several generations of fans in <i>Losing It</i>, <i>Finding It</i> is an optimistic story for trying times. It's about believing in love and happiness, having faith that both are possible, and finding out that God does want you to enjoy life's desserts -- even when you're on a diet.</p></p><p><b>Valerie Bertinelli</b> has been acting since the age of twelve, appearing in more than two dozen made-for-TVmovies.

Currently, she lives with her son, Wolfgang, in Los Angeles.<b><br><b><i>Introduction</i></b></b> <p>I shouldn&#x2019;t have been offended when my boyfriend Tom walked in on me and commented on my underwear. But I was. Most women would agree&#x2014;and may even have had the same conversation. I was cleaning out my dresser drawers as I packed for a weekend trip to Laguna Beach for my forty-ninth birthday. Tom came in and began sifting through a pile of t-shirts, bras, and underwear that I put on the bed in a &#x201c;discard&#x201d; pile. Without asking what I was doing, he jumped into the middle of the process and came up holding a pair of skin-colored panties as if they were fresh roadkill. </p><p>&#x201c;I hope you aren&#x2019;t going to bring these to the beach,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>&#x201c;As a matter of fact, no, I wasn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re being thrown out, along with everything else in that pile.&#x201d; Still, I was curious what he had against them, a perfectly nice pair of underwear. </p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with them?&#x201d; I asked. </p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re granny panties,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>Granny panties? I gave him a look that said, &#x201c;Oh, really, buster. You think so?&#x201d; I had just spent nearly two years having lost 40 pounds; actually a little more at this time. I hadn&#x2019;t gone through that effort to cover my rear end in drapes. My underwear drawer included bikini-style panties, sheer panties, white panties, black panties, a couple of pastel-colored panties, panties whose lines weren&#x2019;t visible through pants, panties I wore to business meetings, panties I wore when I worked out, panties I wore on special occasions, and panties that said I was in the mood. I had panties for nearly every occasion. The one thing I didn&#x2019;t have were granny panties. </p><p>I grabbed the pair in question from Tom. I studied them for a second or two and decided he had no idea what he was talking about. </p><p>&#x201c;These are bikini-style, but with a wider waistband,&#x201d; I explained. &#x201c;If I had them on, you could still see my belly button.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;V, I&#x2019;m going to tell you something,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I hope you don&#x2019;t take offense at hearing it. But you&#x2019;ve had some nasty underwear, and these are at the top of the list.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Oh. My. God,&#x201d; I said, tossing the undies back in the throw-out pile. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Quite the contrary,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a guy. I know about women&#x2019;s underwear.&#x201d; </p><p>A dozen different responses came to mind, none of them nice. I chose a response that is rarely part of my repertoire: I bit my tongue and said nothing. I knew Tom&#x2019;s theory about women&#x2019;s underwear was typical of most men. It consisted of grand expectations (my undies were supposed to be chosen for his pleasure, not my convenience or comfort), disappointment (they could never be small enough), and something I&#x2019;ll call &#x201c;lack-of-string theory&#x201d;&#x2014; basically, they increased in size with age until they got so large that women needed the local fire department&#x2019;s hook and ladder brigade to pull them up (not true of mine in any way, shape, or size, thank you very much!). </p><p>I have a different take. I think that the slingshot-sized thongs that Tom and most men think of as ideal are thoroughly uncomfortable. After a few men walk around with what is essentially a string of dental floss up their butt all day, I would gladly talk to them about women&#x2019;s underwear. That said, panties <i>are</i> a fairly accurate indicator of the way a woman feels about herself. </p><p>As Tom would find out once we got to Laguna, I was feeling pretty good about myself. </p><p>In many ways, I was better than ever. Just a month earlier, I had let the world see me in a bikini. I&#x2019;d shot a commercial and a magazine cover, wearing for the first time what I had not dared put on in almost thirty years. I was a little uncomfortable showing that much skin, but, hey, I&#x2019;d worked my butt off getting in shape, so why not show off a little? </p><p>But getting in a bikini was only part of the story. There was so much more that people couldn&#x2019;t see because the transformation had taken place on the inside, deep down in the gooey center. When I saw myself on the cover of <i>People</i> magazine, I noticed glimpses of it in my eyes. Granted, most people weren&#x2019;t looking there. But I saw a light and an alive-ness and a renewed hunger for life that hadn&#x2019;t been there since I was a kid, back before I&#x2019;d eaten my way through life&#x2019;s challenges, insecurities, fears, and disappointments. </p><p>I was serious when I said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe I did it.&#x201d; But I was talking about more than just fitting into a bikini. </p><p>Losing forty pounds was an accomplishment, and getting into a bikini was the exclamation point to all that effort. But anyone who has lost weight&#x2014;and kept it off&#x2014;knows that shedding pounds is only the first step in the much bigger and longer project of transformation. But I hadn&#x2019;t known this. Why? I had never kept the weight off. </p><p>Over the years, I had gone on more diets than I could count or even remember. Every one of them had worked. I had lost weight. But up till now, I had always failed to keep it off. I&#x2019;m not alone here. Millions of people know what I&#x2019;m talking about. Everyone who has gone on a diet knows how to lose weight. All of us are very good at it. The problem is, few of us know how to keep it off. According to the research I found, between 92 and 95 percent of those who lose weight on a diet end up regaining every one of those pounds, and sometimes a few more, within five years. That&#x2019;s insane. It&#x2019;s a problem. And it begs the question, what are we doing wrong? </p><p>I thought about this after I reached my weight-loss goal and announced to those following my progress that I was transitioning to maintenance. Then, I woke up that next day and the day after and on days after those and asked myself, What does that mean, maintenance? </p><p>One day, I said to myself, &#x201c;Holy crap! I&#x2019;ve been here before and messed up. What had I done wrong? What do I have to do differently this time to keep the weight off?&#x201d; </p><p>Well, as far as I&#x2019;m concerned, this is the part of weight loss that no one ever talks about: the reality of keeping it off. I think the reason why so many of us have always gained back our weight after months of hard work, self-discipline, and sweat is that we don&#x2019;t know what to do once we hit our goal. We aren&#x2019;t given this crucial information. </p><p>I want to change that. Having lost 40 pounds and kept it off for a year, I have figured some things out and acquired some wisdom and insight that I wish I had known as I set out on my weight-loss journey, starting with one fact: Above and beyond all else, losing weight and maintenance are two completely different endeavors. </p><p>I had assumed that switching gears from losing weight to maintenance simply meant watching what I ate and exercising daily, but in a more relaxed mode. I was wrong. Maintaining this new, slimmer, healthier version of myself required even more work. Harder work, too. </p><p>Talk about a shock! </p><p>Talk about a revelation! </p><p>When I looked at this new, thinner version of myself, the one who had reached her goal by losing 40 pounds, the one who was supposedly ready to change gears into maintenance, I realized that I wasn&#x2019;t finished. Inside, I didn&#x2019;t feel finished. As it turned out, I wasn&#x2019;t. </p><p>Who knew? </p><p>I didn&#x2019;t. As I said, on previous diets, I had always lost weight and then regained it plus some extra. I had never been able to keep it off. I would hit my goal, give myself a few days of leniency for good behavior, maybe reward myself with a treat or two and, before I knew it, the weight was piling back on. </p><p>This time I vowed not to let that happen to me. However, after losing weight in front of the world, I didn&#x2019;t want to go through the humiliation of regaining it in front of world. I shuddered at the thought of going into the supermarket and seeing the headlines, &#x201c;Valerie Bertinelli Fat Again.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t want to disappoint myself, either. </p><p>That was the real issue. I looked good, I felt great, and most important I was learning to like myself more and more. I didn&#x2019;t want to lose any of that. In fact, as I discovered, I wanted to keep going! I couldn&#x2019;t believe it. Losing weight was an eye-opener&#x2014;a game-changer, as they say on the sports channels. </p><p>Losing weight was merely the beginning of a process, and I needed to get in sync with that reality and act accordingly. In other words, by dieting, I had only fixed one problem, my weight. To maintain it, I had to work on everything else&#x2014;all the things that had made me get fat in the first place. </p><p>For me, maintenance became not an effort to keep my weight the same but a daily effort to continue to evolve and grow and work at becoming my best self. Since I began, I have found it exciting, frustrating, challenging, confusing, and ultimately the most rewarding project I have tackled. It should be. It&#x2019;s my life! </p><p>In this book, I talk about some of the busiest, hardest, and best days of my life. My teenage son, Wolfie, fell in love; Tom&#x2019;s four wonderful children became more involved in our life together; my mom battled a serious illness; and on top of everything, I worked my butt off (literally) to get into bikini shape for a new Jenny Craig marketing campaign&#x2014;as if, at age forty-eight, I needed that additional test. </p><p>Without knowing any better until I dived in, I needed it more than I realized. It took me to the next level, and along the way I was able to look at the big issues in my life, including family, career, health, friendship, and faith. Though I wasn&#x2019;t always clear about what I believed, my definition of maintenance came to include a deeper sense of faith, a closer relationship with God, and an attempt to find a sense of peace and comfort. </p><p>In many ways, the problems I have had to confront sound like a season&#x2019;s ...</p></p><h2>Charles Dickens: Great Expectations; Hard Times; A Christmas Carol; A Tale of Two Cities (Greenwich Unabridged Library Classics)</h2><p>Presents four masterpieces of Victorian fiction</p><p><b>Charles Dickens</b> is one of the most well-known and respected authors of all time.<br></p><h2>The Stranger</h2><p>Since it was first published in English, in 1946, Albert Camus's extraordinary first novel, The Stranger (L'Etranger), has had a profound impact on millions of American readers. Through this story of an ordinary man who unwittingly gets drawn into a senseless murder on a sun-drenched Algerian beach, Camus was exploring what he termed "the nakedness of man faced with the absurd."<br><br>Now, in an illuminating new American translation (the only English version available for more than forty years was done by a British translator), the original intent of The Stranger is made more immediate, as Matthew Ward captures in exact and lucid language precisely what Camus said and how he said it, thus giving this haunting novel a new life for generations to come.<br><br>Albert Camus, son of a working-class family, was born in Algeria in 1913. He spent the early years of his life in North Africa, where he worked at Various jobs -- in the weather bureau, in an automobile-accessory firm, in a shipping company -- to help pay for his courses at the University of Algiers. He then turned to journalism as a career. His report on the unhappy state of the Muslims of the Kabylie region aroused the Algerian government to action and brought him public notice. From 1935 to 1938 he ran the Theatre de L'Equipe, a theatrical company that produced plays by Malraux, Gide, Synge, Dostoevski, and others. During World War II he was one of the leading writers of the French Resistance and editor of Combat, then an important underground newspaper. Camus was always very active in the theater, and several of his plays have been published and produced. His fiction, including The Stranger, The Plague, The Fall, and Exile and the Kingdom; his philosophical essays, The Myth of Sisyphus and The Rebel; and his plays have assured his preeminent position in modern French letters. In 1957 Camus was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. His sudden death on January 4, 1960, cut short the career of one of the most important literary figures of the Western world when he was at the very summit of his powers.</p><p><i>The Stranger</i> is not merely one of the most widely read novels of the 20th century, but one of the books likely to outlive it. Written in 1946, Camus's compelling and troubling tale of a disaffected, apparently amoral young man has earned a durable popularity (and remains a staple of U.S. high school literature courses) in part because it reveals so vividly the anxieties of its time. Alienation, the fear of anonymity, spiritual doubt--all could have been given a purely modern inflection in the hands of a lesser talent than Camus, who won the Nobel Prize in 1957 and was noted for his existentialist aesthetic. The remarkable trick of <i>The Stranger</i>, however, is that it's not mired in period philosophy.<p> The plot is simple. A young Algerian, Meursault, afflicted with a sort of aimless inertia, becomes embroiled in the petty intrigues of a local pimp and, somewhat inexplicably, ends up killing a man. Once he's imprisoned and eventually brought to trial, his crime, it becomes apparent, is not so much the arguably defensible murder he has committed as it is his deficient character. The trial's proceedings are absurd, a parsing of incidental trivialities--that Meursault, for instance, seemed unmoved by his own mother's death and then attended a comic movie the evening after her funeral are two ostensibly damning facts--so that the eventual sentence the jury issues is both ridiculous and inevitable.</p><p> Meursault remains a cipher nearly to the story's end--dispassionate, clinical, disengaged from his own emotions. "She wanted to know if I loved her," he says of his girlfriend. "I answered the same way I had the last time, that it didn't mean anything but that I probably didn't." There's a latent ominousness in such observations, a sense that devotion is nothing more than self-delusion. It's undoubtedly true that Meursault exhibits an extreme of resignation; however, his confrontation with "the gentle indifference of the world" remains as compelling as it was when Camus first recounted it. <i>--Ben Guterson</i></p>Born in Algeria in 1913, Albert Camus published <i>The Stranger</i>&#x2013;now one of the most widely read novels of this century&#x2013;in 1942. Celebrated in intellectual circles, Camus was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957. On January 4, 1960, he was killed in a car accident.</p><h2>The Diversity of Life (Questions of Science)</h2><p><p><strong>"A superb blend of lyrical description, sweeping historical writing, lucid scientific explanation, and dire warnings. . . . The most important scientific book of the year." &#x2015; <em>Boston Globe</em></strong></p> In this book a master scientist tells the story of how life on earth evolved. Edward O. Wilson eloquently describes how the species of the world became diverse and why that diversity is threatened today as never before. A great spasm of extinction &#x2015; the disappearance of whole species &#x2015; is occurring now, caused this time entirely by humans. Unlike the deterioration of the physical environment, which can be halted, the loss of biodiversity is a far more complex problem &#x2015; and it is irreversible. Defining a new environmental ethic, Wilson explains why we must rescue whole ecosystems, not only individual species. He calls for an end to conservation versus development arguments, and he outlines the massive shift in priorities needed to address this challenge. No writer, no scientist, is more qualified than Edward O. Wilson to describe, as he does here, the grandeur of evolution and what is at stake. "Engaging and nontechnical prose. . . . Prodigious erudition. . . . Original and fascinating insights." &#x2015; John Terborgh, <em>New York Review of Books</em>, front page review "Eloquent. . . . A profound and enduring contribution." &#x2015; Alan Burdick, <em>Audubon</em> Color plates</p><p>Humans, the Harvard University entomologist Edward O. Wilson has observed, have an innate--or at least extremely ancient--connection to the natural world, and our continued divorce from it has led to the loss of not only "a vast intellectual legacy born of intimacy" with nature, but also our very sanity. In <i>The Diversity of Life</i>, Wilson takes a sweeping view of our planet's natural richness, remarking on what on the surface seems a paradox: "almost all the species that ever lived are extinct, and yet more are alive today than at any time in the past." (Wilson's elegant explanation is a scientific education in itself.) This great variety of species is, of course, threatened by habitat destruction, global climate change, and a host of other forces, and Wilson revisits his oft-stated call for the protection of wilderness and undeveloped land, noting that "wilderness has virtue unto itself and needs no extraneous justification." We should, he continues, regard every species, "every scrap of biodiversity," as precious and irreplaceable, without attempting to quantify that regard with utilitarian measures such as "bio-economics." In short, Wilson offers with this book a simple, workable environmental ethic that extends the work of Aldo Leopold and other conservationists. A remarkably productive and influential scientist, Wilson is also a fine writer, and his survey of biodiversity makes for welcome and instructive reading. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Edward O. Wilson is the author of more than thirty books, including Anthill, a novel, and The Meaning of Human Existence, a finalist for the National Book Award. The winner of two Pulitzer Prizes, Wilson is a professor emeritus at Harvard University and lives with his wife, Irene, in Lexington, Massachusetts.</p><h2>Our Hearts Fell to the Ground: Plains Indian Views of How the West Was Lost (Bedford Series in History and Culture)</h2><p><p>This unique anthology chronicles the Plains Indians' struggle to maintain their traditional way of life in the changing world of the nineteenth century.

We own radiation-emitting phones, regularly get diagnostic x-rays, such as mammograms, and submit to full-body security scans at airports. We worry and debate about the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the safety of nuclear power plants. But how much do we really know about radiation? And what are its actual dangers? An accessible blend of narrative history and science, <i>Strange Glow</i> describes mankind's extraordinary, thorny relationship with radiation, including the hard-won lessons of how radiation helps and harms our health. Timothy Jorgensen explores how our knowledge of and experiences with radiation in the last century can lead us to smarter personal decisions about radiation exposures today.</p><p>Jorgensen introduces key figures in the story of radiation&#x2015;from Wilhelm Roentgen, the discoverer of x-rays, and pioneering radioactivity researchers Marie and Pierre Curie, to Thomas Edison and the victims of the recent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. Tracing the most important events in the evolution of radiation, Jorgensen explains exactly what radiation is, how it produces certain health consequences, and how we can protect ourselves from harm. He also considers a range of practical scenarios such as the risks of radon in our basements, radiation levels in the fish we eat, questions about cell-phone use, and radiation's link to cancer. Jorgensen empowers us to make informed choices while offering a clearer understanding of broader societal issues.</p><p>Investigating radiation's benefits and risks, <i>Strange Glow</i> takes a remarkable look at how, for better or worse, radiation has transformed our society.</p></p><p>People like to get their learning in the form of stories. If you tell an engaging and compelling story, people will learn something from it and they will retain that knowledge. So that's what I attempt to do in <i>Strange Glow</i>. The book is the story of man's encounters with radiation, and how mankind has been transformed by the experience. The story is told with an emphasis on the human aspects, and it is told from a health-centric perspective. The goal is to integrate the technological aspects of radiation within the human experience and, thereby, remove some of the mystery and misunderstanding that surrounds radiation. Nevertheless, this is not a book about lessening your fear of radiation. Fear is a very subjective emotion, driven by many factors. The only thing that this book can achieve is to present the facts about radiation as objectively and evenhandedly as possible, leaving its readers to decide for themselves which aspects of radiation they should fear. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another purpose of this book is to dispel the myth that the subject of radiation risks is so complicated that it is beyond the capability of ordinary people to grasp, leaving as their only recourse reliance on radiation "experts." This is simply not true. Intelligent people, even those lacking any technical background, should be able to understand the fundamental principles that drive radiation risk and make their own decisions about how large a threat radiation poses to them individually and to society at large. This book seeks to convince people that they can be masters of their own radiation fate, and to empower them to make their own well-informed decisions about their personal radiation exposures.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, this book is an experiment in risk communication. The open question is whether radiation risks can be characterized accurately and effectively without reliance on a lot of mathematics, tables, and graphs. These highly quantitative approaches have proved to be largely ineffective in communicating the essence of risk to the public. This book is devoid of graphs and tables and keeps the mathematics to a minimum. Instead, it tries to instill a sense of the magnitude of the threat through a historical scientific narrative about the people who encountered radiation of various types and dose levels, and the health consequences of those exposures. In this way, we can get an accurate sense of the level of the radiation hazard even without a detailed understanding of the underlying technology.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I have done my job well, all readers of this book will enjoy interesting stories of scientific discovery while, at the same time, learn a tremendous amount about radiation. They should also find their new understanding of radiation personally useful in many practical ways. I hope you will find it so.<p>"The discovery of radiation opened the way to the modern era and created one of humanity's greatest moral challenges. In this lucid book, Timothy Jorgensen explains the mechanics of radiation, tells the stories of those who helped uncover it, and gives us a careful assessment of how it continues to influence people and society."<b>--Tom Zoellner, author of <i>Uranium: War, Energy, and the Rock That Shaped the World</i></b></p><p>"A thoroughly readable book about an important subject. The sometimes bizarre, sometimes brilliant story of the discovery of radioactivity and its effects on living things is told in an enlightening and entertaining way. I found it surprisingly reassuring."<b>--Penny Le Couteur, coauthor of <i>Napoleon's Buttons: How Seventeen Molecules Changed History</i></b></p><p>"<i>Strange Glow</i> is an accessible book that presents a huge amount of information about radiation.

Useful to radiation experts and general audiences alike, the knowledge gathered here is enormous and full of insights."<b>--Ohtsura Niwa, Fukushima Medical University</b></p><p>"Through stories and examples, rather than graphs and equations, this lucid book explains the discovery, benefits, and dangers of different forms of radiation, and it examines qualms about nuclear power, cancer treatment, possible radon in the basement, and extensive cell-phone use. <i>Strange Glow</i> is both a fine history and a deft elucidation of risk assessment."<b>--David E. Nye, author of <i>Technology Matters: Questions to Live With</i></b></p><p>"Jorgensen's history is an engaging and entertaining attempt to make us feel more secure about the sea of radiation in which we live."<b>--Kate Brown, author of <i>Plutopia: Nuclear Families, Atom Cities, and the Great Soviet and American Plutonium Disasters</i></b></p><p>"This fascinating book is well written, entertaining, and informative. I don't know of another book that takes such a comprehensive look at radiation and it will enjoy a large and diverse readership."<b>--William F. Morgan, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</b></p></p><h2>The Corset: A Cultural History</h2><p>The corset is probably the most controversial garment in the history of fashion. Although regarded as an essential element of fashionable dress from the Renaissance into the twentieth century, the corset was also frequently condemned as an instrument of torture and the cause of ill health. Why did women continue to don steel and whalebone corsets for four hundred years? And why did they finally stop? This lavishly illustrated book offers fascinating and often surprising answers to these questions. Valerie Steele, one of the world&#x2019;s most respected fashion historians, explores the cultural history of the corset, demolishing myths about this notorious garment and revealing new information and perspectives on its changing significance over the centuries. <br><br>Whereas most historians have framed the history of the corset in terms of oppression vs. liberation and fashion vs. health and comfort, Steele contends that women&#x2019;s experiences of corsetry varied considerably and cannot be fully understood within these narrow frames. Drawing on extensive research in textual, visual, and materials sources, the author disproves the beliefs that the corset was dangerously unhealthy and was designed primarily for the oppression of women. Women persisted in wearing corsets&#x2015;despite powerful male authorities trying to dissuade them&#x2015;because corsetry had positive connotations of social status, self-discipline, youth, and beauty. In the twentieth century the garment itself fell out of fashion but, Steele points out, it has become internalized as women replace the boned corset with diet, exercise, and plastic surgery. The book concludes with insightful analyses of such recent developments as the reconception of the corset as a symbol of rebellion and female sexual empowerment, the revival of the corset in contemporary high fashion, and its transformation from an item of underwear to outerwear.</p><p>Named one of the Best of the Year 2001 by the Toronto Globe &amp; Mail; Selected for inclusion in the "Books to Remember" list by the New York Public Library; Winner of the 2002 Milia Davenport Publication Award sponsored by the Costume Society of America"This is cultural scholarship and social history at its absolute best."&#x2014;Literary Review; "The Corset is at once couture eye candy and intellectually enlightening."&#x2014;Women&#x2019;s Review of Books ; "Obligatory reading for fashion historians."&#x2014;Times Literary Supplement</p><h2>Collected Shorter Plays</h2><p>Contains Beckett's less than full-length works for stage, radio and television, in chronological order of composition.<br></p><p>&#39;Beckett reduces life, perception, and writing to barest minimums: a few dimly seen, struggling torsos; a hopeless intelligence compulsively seeking to come to terms, in rudimentary yet endlessly varied language, with the human condition they represent.

Schmalleger&#x2019;s philosophy of both teaching and writing can be summed up in these words: &#x201c;In order to communicate knowledge we must first catch, then hold, a person&#x2019;s interest&#x2014;be it student, colleague, or policymaker. Our writing, our speaking, and our teaching must be relevant to the problems facing people today, and they must in some way help solve those problems.</p></p><h2>Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics</h2><p>The number one text in its field, Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics is respected by professors and students alike for its comprehensive topical coverage, its varied examples and homework problems, its application of the visual component of fluid mechanics, and its strong focus on learning.

But once we accept that fact, the questions begin. In this thought-provoking book, philosophy professor Shelly Kagan examines the myriad questions that arise when we confront the meaning of mortality. Do we have reason to believe in the existence of immortal souls? Or should we accept an account according to which people are just material objects, nothing more? Can we make sense of the idea of surviving the death of one&#x2019;s body? If I won&#x2019;t exist after I die, can death truly be <i>bad</i> for me? Would immortality be desirable? Is fear of death appropriate? Is suicide ever justified? How should I <i>live</i> in the face of death?</p><p>Written in an informal and conversational style, this stimulating and provocative book challenges many widely held views about death, as it invites the reader to take a fresh look at one of the central features of the human condition&#x2014;the fact that we will die.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Shelly Kagan</b> is Clark Professor of Philosophy, Yale University.

So begins Kafka's famous short story, <em>The Metamorphosis</em>. Kafka considered publishing it with two of the stories included here in a volume to be called <em>Punishments. The Judgment</em> explores an enigmatic power struggle between a father and son, while <em>In the Penal Colony</em> examines questions of power, justice, punishment, and the meaning of pain in a colonial setting. These three stories are flanked by two very different works. <em>Meditation</em>, the first book Kafka published, consists of light, whimsical, often poignant mood-pictures, while the autobiographical <em>Letter to his Father</em> analyzes his difficult relationship with his father in devastating detail. This new translation by Joyce Crick pays particular attention to the nuances of Kafka's style, and the Introduction and notes by Ritchie Robertson provide guidance to this most enigmatic and rewarding of writers. There is also a Biographical Preface, an up-to-date bibliography, and a chronology of Kafka's life.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

How are we to account for the current prestige and power of quantitative methods? The usual answer is that quantification is seen as desirable in social and economic investigation as a result of its successes in the study of nature. Theodore Porter is not content with this. Why should the kind of success achieved in the study of stars, molecules, or cells be an attractive model for research on human societies? he asks. And, indeed, how should we understand the pervasiveness of quantification in the sciences of nature? In his view, we should look in the reverse direction: comprehending the attractions of quantification in business, government, and social research will teach us something new about its role in psychology, physics, and medicine.</p><br><p> Drawing on a wide range of examples from the laboratory and from the worlds of accounting, insurance, cost-benefit analysis, and civil engineering, Porter shows that it is "exactly wrong" to interpret the drive for quantitative rigor as inherent somehow in the activity of science except where political and social pressures force compromise. Instead, quantification grows from attempts to develop a strategy of impersonality in response to pressures from outside. Objectivity derives its impetus from cultural contexts, quantification becoming most important where elites are weak, where private negotiation is suspect, and where trust is in short supply.</p></p><p><p>"A fine, scholarly account of how numerical measurements are used both to standardize results and to communicate them unambiguously."<b>--Jon Turney</b></p><p>"Ted Porter's work on the history of quantification transforms our understanding of the social meaning of numbers, and of the social meaning of objectivity."<b>--Evelyn Fox Keller, MIT</b></p><p>"This book is a wholly original contribution to both political science and moral philosophy, written with the precision of an historian skilled at bringing to life the dustiest of bureaucratic archives."<b>--Ian Hacking, University of Toronto</b></p><p>"This is a fascinating and innovative book, which breaks new cross-disciplinary ground.

In <i>Dancing on Our Turtle s Back: Stories of Nishnaabeg Re-Creation, Resurgence, and a New Emergence</i> activist, editor, and educator Leanne Simpson asserts reconciliation must be grounded in political resurgence and must support the regeneration of Indigenous languages, oral cultures, and traditions of governance. Simpson explores philosophies and pathways of regeneration, resurgence, and a new emergence through the Nishnaabeg language, Creation Stories, walks with Elders and children, celebrations and protests, and meditations on these experiences. She stresses the importance of illuminating Indigenous intellectual traditions to transform their relationship to the Canadian state.

This book provides a valuable perspective on the struggles of Indigenous peoples but also highlights the rich and vibrant ways in which Indigenous people continue to engage themselves. -- <strong>Christine McFarlane, in <em>Windspeaker</em></strong></p><p><em>Leanne Simpson's Dancing on Our Turtle's Back</em> is a beautifully crafted clarion call specifically directed to the Nishnaabeg Nation and the Mississauga Ojibway, the original inhabitants of the Kawarthas.
